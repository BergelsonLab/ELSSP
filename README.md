This repo contains the scripts, data, and figures for the 2020 ELSSP manuscript, title TBD.

Many of these files originally lived in Github/BergelsonLab/HI_CDI. The purpose of creating this new repo is to have a clean folder that can be public facing.

Data contains CDI data from deaf/hard-of-hearing infants and normative CDI data from Wordbank.

Figures contains any figures generated from these data.

In the main folder:
CDI_ELSSP.R preps CDI data and create a growth curve from the normative data. Also contains code functions for models figures. Sourced by "Difference from CDI Norms.ipynb"
"Difference from CDI Norms.ipynb" contains code for individual analyses and figures, from functions in CDI_ELSSP.R.
Both of these files were written primarily by Stephan Meylan.

Growth_curve_problem:
Contains a set of files generated by running the prepare_elssp_df function once with the normative data and once with the cross-sectional sample (both from wordbank) for WG/WS English/Spanish. These files are read in by growth_curve_probs.Rmd, but otherwise not used.
