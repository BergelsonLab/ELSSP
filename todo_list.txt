Need to fix for ELSSP:

Updated: 1/26/2021

Green:
- resize plots
- bigger labels on graphs
- move any extra graphs to extra graphs rmd


Yellow:
- write abstract
- caption figures/tables better
- citing packages
- make sure that figure labels consistent with text throughout (e.g., HLworse)
- clean GH repo for public
- subscript formatting doesn't work
- Ns for wordbook norms seem high
- citations don't render in footnote?


Red:
- make OSF page
- goodness of fit statistic
