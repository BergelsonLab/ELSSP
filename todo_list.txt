Need to fix for ELSSP:

Content:
- growth curves :/
- check for causal language
- make OSF page
- what to do with adopted participant
- caption tables
- table with all betas
- make sure mixed HL and cued speech removed from chi-square
- last paragraph of Part I discussion

Frill:
- change axis labels on tile plot
- table #s
- citing packages
- p value display
- bigger labels on graphs
- make sure that figure labels consistent with text throughout (e.g., HLworse)
