- Add captions to all plots / tables
- Change labels on figures to align with text (e.g., HLworse -> degree)
- Bigger labels on graphs
- simplify table code
- wordbook curves display twice?
- In part III, I have the equations printed twice, once in equation formatting. Not sure what to use.
- inconsistent spacing around =s
