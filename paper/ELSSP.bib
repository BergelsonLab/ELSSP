  abstract = {Background: Auditory neural myelination (ANM) as evaluated by auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) during the neonatal period has been used as a surrogate outcome for long-term neurodevelopment. The validity of ANM as a surrogate outcome for long-term neurodevelopment has not been well studied. Aim: Evaluate the association of ABR I-V interpeak latency (IPL), an index of ANM, at 35. week postmenstrual age (PMA) with language outcome at 3. years of age. Design: Prospective study. Subjects: 24-33. week gestational age (GA) infants were eligible if they did not meet exclusion criteria: craniofacial malformation, chromosomal disorders, deafness, auditory dys-synchrony, TORCH infection, or non-English speaking parents. Infants with malignancy, head injury, encephalopathy, meningitis, blindness, or who died or relocated were also excluded. Outcome measures: ABRs were performed at 35. week PMA using 80. dB nHL and I-V IPL (ms) measured. Auditory Comprehension (AC) and Expressive Communication (EC) were evaluated by a speech-language pathologist at 3. years of age using Preschool Language Scale. Results: Eighty infants were studied. The mean GA and birth weight of infants were 29.2. weeks and 1336. g, respectively. There was association of worse ear I-V IPL and better ear I-V IPL with AC (Coefficient. -. 5.4, 95\% CI: -. 9.8 to -. 0.9 and Coefficient. -. 5.5, 95\% CI: -. 10 to-0.9, respectively) and EC (Coefficient. -. 5.6, 95\% CI: -. 9.5 to-1.8 and Coefficient. -. 6.7, 95\% CI: -. 10.6. to-2.7, respectively) after controlling for confounders. Conclusion: The neonatal I-V IPL is a predictor of language development at 3. years of age in preterms.},

The tests of between-subjects effects for second-generation children was significantly higher than for first-generation children for all intelligence scales except knowledge. It can be assumed that second-generation children joined their family in the use of sign language as the primary experience before a cochlear implant. The use of sign language before cochlear implants is recommended.},

The ASL-CDI is an inventory of sign glosses organized into semantic categories targeted to assess sign language skills in children ages 8 to 36 months. The ASL-CDI uses a recognition format in which parents check off signs that their child produces. The form has demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. To date, normative data have been collected from 69 deaf children with deaf parents who are learning sign language as a first language. We discuss the development of the ASl-CDI and preliminary cross-sectional and longitudinal findings from this early data collection with particular focus on parallels with spoken language acquisition.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the current literature to quantify the impact of unilateral hearing loss on children, with the use of objective measures of speech and language. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2015. Manual searches of references were also completed. Review Methods All studies that described speech and language outcomes for children with unilateral hearing loss were included. Outcome measures included results from any test of speech and language that evaluated or had age-standardized norms. Due to heterogeneity of the data, quantitative analysis could not be completed. Qualitative analysis was performed on the included studies. Two independent evaluators reviewed each abstract and article. Results A total of 429 studies were identified; 13 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Overall, 7 studies showed poorer scores on various speech and language tests, with effects more pronounced for children with severe to profound hearing loss. Four studies did not demonstrate any difference in testing results between patients with unilateral hearing loss and those with normal hearing. Two studies that evaluated effects on speech and language longitudinally showed initial speech problems, with improvement in scores over time. Conclusions There are inconsistent data regarding effects of unilateral hearing loss on speech and language outcomes for children. The majority of recent studies suggest poorer speech and language testing results, especially for patients with severe to profound unilateral hearing loss.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine prognostic factors of cochlear implantation and to evaluate the impact of early implantation on linguistic development in deaf children. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Seventy-four prelingually deafened children implanted before the age of 5 years. INTERVENTION: Annual follow-up after cochlear implantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Speech perception, intelligibility, and expressive and receptive language scores from age 3 to 8 years were globally compared between 4 subgroups of children. Significant differences were further explored by intergroup comparisons. Stepwise logistic linear regression was performed using the following variables: age at implantation, duration of cochlear implant (CI) use, preoperative hearing levels, age of hearing aid (HA) fitting, and age at time of the evaluation. Preoperative data were not available. RESULTS: Between group comparisons displayed significant differences according to age at implantation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the positive impact of early implantation on receptive language. Moreover, duration of CI use and preoperative hearing levels were statistically correlated with performance on speech perception, intelligibility, and expressive and receptive language. Age of HA fitting was associated with speech intelligibility. CONCLUSION: Age at implantation, duration of CI, preoperative hearing levels, and age of HA fitting may each be useful in predicting linguistic success after cochlear implantation. Other factors such as preoperative linguistic development may also influence postoperative outcomes, but the lack of tests suitable for use with very young children makes such a hypothesis difficult to confirm. \textcopyright{} 2009 Otology \& Neurotology, Inc.},

Study design: Electronic databases were systematically searched, and 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were calculated to compare VPT/VLBW children and control children. Results: VPT/VLBW children performed between 0.38 and 0.77 SD below control subjects in the areas of expressive and receptive language overall and expressive and receptive semantics. Results for expressive and receptive grammar were equivocal. Subgroup analysis of school-aged children revealed similar results. No studies assessing phonological awareness, discourse, or pragmatics were identified. Conclusions: Language ability is reduced in VPT/VLBW children. When considering only school-aged children, this reduction is still present, suggesting that their difficulty appears to be ongoing. Rigorous studies examining a range of language subdomains are needed to fully understand the specific nature of language difficulties in this population. \textcopyright{} 2011 Mosby Inc.

Despite the importance of vocabulary knowledge, very little information is available about effective strategies for vocabulary instruction in elementary grades and there is a paucity of data on the relative merits of the different programs that are designed to promote vocabulary growth in elementary children. Available information indicates that, until they reach about grade three, children's vocabulary knowledge is largely determined by informal factors such as parental interaction and other incidental sources such as the TV. In this article, I will address the following topics: (a) individual differences in vocabulary acquisition, (b) the amount of vocabulary needed for successful learning, (c) the predictable sequence of vocabulary acquisition, (d) the need for direct instruction for vocabulary growth, and (e) promising methods for promoting vocabulary knowledge.},

Study Design: Retrospective case review. Setting: Tertiary referral center and cochlear implant program. Patients: Records were reviewed for children 0 to 16 years old inclusive, who had cochlear implant-related operations over a 12-month period. INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic and rehabilitative. Main Outcome Measures: Additional disabilities prevalence; medical history and radiologic abnormalities; and the effect on Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) score at 12 months postoperatively. Results: Eighty-eight children having 96 operations were identified. The overall prevalence of additional disabilities (including developmental delay, cerebral palsy, visual impairment, autism and attention deficit disorder) was 33\%. The main conditions associated with additional disabilities were syndromes and chromosomal abnormalities (87\%), jaundice (86\%), prematurity (62\%), cytomegalovirus (60\%), and inner ear abnormalities including cochlea nerve hypoplasia or aplasia (75\%) and semicircular canal anomalies (56\%). At 12 months postoperatively, almost all (96\%) of the children without additional disabilities had a CAP score of 5 or greater (speech), compared with 52\% of children with additional disabilities. Children with developmental delay had a median CAP score of 4, at 12 months compared with 6 for those without developmental delay. Conclusion: Additional disabilities are prevalent in approximately a third of pediatric cochlear implant patients. Additional disabilities significantly affect the outcomes of cochlear implants. \textcopyright{} 2012, Otology \& Neurotology, Inc.},

Previous studies suggested that children with UHL would benefit from frequency-modulated assistive devices only. The objective of this study was to examine whether children with UHL would benefit from using a conventional hearing aid in the poorer-hearing ear. METHODS: Eight children, 7 to 12 years of age, with mild to moderately severe UHL and their parents and teachers participated in this study. The participants were fitted with digital hearing aids by use of pediatric prescriptive targets. The primary outcome measures were speech perception tests in quiet and noise and subjective assessments from participants, parents, and teachers, administered before hearing aid fitting and after 3 months of hearing aid use. RESULTS: The group average speech perception scores showed no significant aided benefit or detriment in any of the conditions tested. However, subjective assessments showed large significant aided benefits at home and school according to the children and their parents, and in quality of life as reported by the children with UHL. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that a hearing aid trial should be considered for children with mild to moderately severe UHL, with individual monitoring for benefit.},

Design: A comprehensive review of the literature was used to identify relevant articles for the review. Study Sample: Five research articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: Three primary themes emerged: (1) deafness causality, parents tended to describe the cause of the hearing loss in terms of religion and folk beliefs; (2) cultural attitudes, parents reported having paternalistic views related to the care of their child and experiencing community stigma, and (3) cultural values, parents described how personalism, familism, fatalism, and respect informed their perspectives. Conclusions: This comprehensive literature review found that limited research has been done to understand beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of Hispanic parents toward pediatric hearing loss. Synthesis of five studies revealed important cultural factors for audiologists to consider in the provision of patient-centered care. Beliefs related to the cause of hearing loss, cultural values, and integration of children within the Hispanic community, may be critical elements for audiologists to address when promoting parental engagement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hearing aid fitting in infancy has become more common in the United States as a result of earlier identification of hearing loss. Consistency of hearing aid use is an area of concern for young children, as well as other hearing aid management challenges parents encounter that may contribute to less-than-optimal speech and language outcomes. Research that describes parent hearing aid management experiences of Spanish-speaking Hispanic families, or the extent of their needs, is not available. To effectively support parent learning, in a culturally sensitive manner, providers may benefit from having a better understanding of the needs and challenges Hispanic families experience with hearing aid management. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to describe challenges with hearing aid management and use for children from birth to 5 yr of age, as reported by Spanish-speaking parents in the United States, and factors that may influence hearing aid use. RESEARCH DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional survey design. STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-two Spanish-speaking parents of children up to 5 yr of age who had been fitted with hearing aids. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Responses were obtained from surveys mailed to parents through early intervention programs and audiology clinics. Descriptive statistics were used to describe frequencies and variance in responses. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of the parents reported the need for help from an interpreter during audiology appointments. Even though parents received information and were taught skills by their audiologist, many wanted to receive more information. For example, 59\% wanted to know how to meet other parents of children who have hearing loss, although 88\% had previously received this information; 56\% wanted to know how to do basic hearing aid maintenance, although 71\% had previously received instruction. The two most frequently reported hearing aid use challenges were fear of losing the hearing aids, and not seeing benefit from the hearing aids. Hearing aid use during all waking hours was reported by more parents (66\%) when their child had a good day than when their child had a bad day (37\%); during the previous two weeks, 35\% of the parents indicated their child had all good days. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic parents wanted more comprehensive information, concrete resources, and emotional support from the audiologist to overcome hearing aid management challenges. Understanding parents' perspectives, experiences, and challenges is critical for audiologists to provide appropriate support in a culturally sensitive manner and to effectively address families' needs.},

Design: A comprehensive review of the literature was used to identify relevant articles for the review. Study Sample: Five research articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: Three primary themes emerged: (1) deafness causality, parents tended to describe the cause of the hearing loss in terms of religion and folk beliefs; (2) cultural attitudes, parents reported having paternalistic views related to the care of their child and experiencing community stigma, and (3) cultural values, parents described how personalism, familism, fatalism, and respect informed their perspectives. Conclusions: This comprehensive literature review found that limited research has been done to understand beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of Hispanic parents toward pediatric hearing loss. Synthesis of five studies revealed important cultural factors for audiologists to consider in the provision of patient-centered care. Beliefs related to the cause of hearing loss, cultural values, and integration of children within the Hispanic community, may be critical elements for audiologists to address when promoting parental engagement.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aim of the study was to assess the mean age at diagnosis of bilateral congenital hearing loss in the Audiology and Phoniatry Centre of the University of Turin, pointing out, by North-West Italy experience, the role of the newborn hearing screening in anticipating the age of diagnosis. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Forty-six congenital deaf babies were reviewed and age at diagnosis was assessed for each, taking in consideration the role of hearing loss risk factors. Eighteen babies (39\%) were sent by the centres that participate to the newborn hearing screening program while 28 (61\%) came for parental or pediatrician suspicion of hearing loss and for general language delay. Sixteen babies (35\%) presented risk factors for hearing loss. RESULTS: The mean age of identification of severe to profound hearing loss was 20.5 months (S.D.=15.3) in the whole group; considering the group of 28 babies not screened the mean age was 29.3 months (S.D.=13.4). This value decreased to 6.8 months (S.D.=3.6) in the group which underwent screening programme. This difference was statistically significant at Student's t-test (p{$<$}0.001). The average ages of diagnosis for healthy versus high risk children were significantly different only in the group of screened babies (p{$<$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood hearing impairment is one of the most common of congenital disorders, and even though there is a general trend of early identification, in reality age of diagnosis is as yet still too late even in developed countries. Our results show that newborn hearing screening could reduce the age at which infants with hearing loss are diagnosed and treated; this would improve speech, language, auditory outcome and the quality of parents and infant life.},

Method: The CDI was used to index the early expressive language skills of 32 pediatric CI users after an average of 1.03 years (SD = 0.56, range = 0.39\textendash 2.17) of CI experience. Long-term neurocognitive outcomes were assessed after an average of 11.32 (SD = 2.54, range = 7.08\textendash 16.52) years of CI experience. Measures of long-term neurocognitive outcomes were derived from gold-standard performancebased and questionnaire-based assessments of language, executive functioning, and academic skills. Result: Analyses revealed that early expressive language skills, collected on average 1.03 years post cochlear implantation, predicted long-term language, executive functioning, and academic skills up to 16 years later. Conclusion: These findings suggest that early expressive language skills, as indexed by the CDI, are clinically relevant for identifying CI users who may be at high risk for long-term neurocognitive delays and disturbances.},

  abstract = {There are now many recipients of unilateral cochlear implants who have usable residual hearing in the non-implanted ear. To avoid auditory deprivation and to provide binaural hearing, a hearing aid or a second cochlear implant can be fitted to that ear. This article addresses the question of whether better binaural hearing can be achieved with binaural/bimodal fitting (combining a cochlear implant and a hearing aid in opposite ears) or bilateral implantation. In the first part of this article, the rationale for providing binaural hearing is examined. In the second part, the literature on the relative efficacy of binaural/bimodal fitting and bilateral implantation is reviewed. Most studies on comparing either mode of bilateral stimulation with unilateral implantation reported some binaural benefits in some test conditions on average but revealed that some individuals benefited, whereas others did not. There were no controlled comparisons between binaural/bimodal fitting and bilateral implantation and no evidence to support the efficacy of one mode over the other. In the third part of the article, a crossover trial of two adults who had binaural/bimodal fitting and who subsequently received a second implant is reported. The findings at 6 and 12 months after they received their second implant indicated that binaural function developed over time, and the extent of benefit depended on which abilities were assessed for the individual. In the fourth and final parts of the article, clinical issues relating to candidacy for binaural/ bimodal fitting and strategies for bimodal fitting are discussed with implications for future research. \textcopyright{} 2007, Sage Publications.

The language abilities of children were evaluated using the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) and Child Development Inventory (CDI). Everyday functioning of children was evaluated by interviewing parents using the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/oral performance of Children (PEACH) questionnaire. There were significant correlations among language measures, and also between the standardized language measures and the PEACH. On average, children who had language deficits exhibited difficulties in everyday functioning. The evidence lends support to a systematic use of parents' observations to evaluate communicative functioning of children in real life. On average, children's language attainment decreased as hearing loss increased, more so for children of less highly educated parents. Factors that were not significantly associated with speech and language outcomes at 3 years were age of amplification and socioeconomic status. As multiple factors affect children's outcomes, it will be possible to examine their effects on outcomes of children when all data in the LOCHI study are available. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Speech Pathology Association of Australia Limited.},

  abstract = {Objective: To address the question of whether, on a population level, early detection and amplification improve outcomes of children with hearing impairment. DESIGN: All families of children who were born between 2002 and 2007, and who presented for hearing services below 3 years of age at Australian Hearing pediatric centers in New South Wales, Victoria, and Southern Queensland were invited to participate in a prospective study on outcomes. Children's speech, language, functional, and social outcomes were assessed at 3 years of age, using a battery of age-appropriate tests. Demographic information relating to the child, family, and educational intervention was solicited through the use of custom-designed questionnaires. Audiological data were collected from the national database of Australian Hearing and records held at educational intervention agencies for children. Regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of each of 15 predictor variables, including age of amplification, on outcomes. Results: Four hundred and fifty-one children enrolled in the study, 56\% of whom received their first hearing aid fitting before 6 months of age. On the basis of clinical records, 44 children (10\%) were diagnosed with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. There were 107 children (24\%) reported to have additional disabilities. At 3 years of age, 317 children (70\%) were hearing aid users and 134 children (30\%) used cochlear implants. On the basis of parent reports, about 71\% used an aural/oral mode of communication, and about 79\% used English as the spoken language at home. Children's performance scores on standardized tests administered at 3 years of age were used in a factor analysis to derive a global development factor score. On average, the global score of hearing-impaired children was more than 1 SD below the mean of normal-hearing children at the same age. Regression analysis revealed that five factors, including female gender, absence of additional disabilities, less severe hearing loss, higher maternal education, and (for children with cochlear implants) earlier age of switch-on were associated with better outcomes at the 5\% significance level. Whereas the effect of age of hearing aid fitting on child outcomes was weak, a younger age at cochlear implant switch-on was significantly associated with better outcomes for children with cochlear implants at 3 years of age. Conclusions: Fifty-six percent of the 451 children were fitted with hearing aids before 6 months of age. At 3 years of age, 134 children used cochlear implants and the remaining children used hearing aids. On average, outcomes were well below population norms. Significant predictors of child outcomes include: presence/absence of additional disabilities, severity of hearing loss, gender, maternal education, together with age of switch-on for children with cochlear implants. \textcopyright{} 2013 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

It appears that the combined use of signed and spoken input can boost early language development significantly, this evidence coming initially from single case-studies, and more recently from larger scale controlled studies. Research with typically developing hearing and deaf children, as well as children with Down syndrome, has demonstrated the importance of establishing joint attention for vocabulary development. Furthermore, studies carried out with children with Down syndrome indicate that reducing attentional demands may be especially important in scaffolding language development in this group. The use of signing strategies which have been found to facilitate language development in deaf children when signing to children with Down syndrome is discussed, as is the need for further research on this topic and on the importance of joint attention for the use of other augmentative and alternative communication systems, such as graphic symbol and picture systems.},

DESIGN: Prospective national cohort studies. SETTING: Maternity and neonatal units in England. PARTICIPANTS: 3133 births between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation in 2006; 666 admissions to neonatal units in 1995 and 1115 in 2006 of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival to discharge from hospital, pregnancy and delivery outcomes, infant morbidity until discharge. RESULTS: In 2006, survival of live born babies was 2\% (n=3) for those born at 22 weeks' gestation, 19\% (n=66) at 23 weeks, 40\% (n=178) at 24 weeks, 66\% (n=346) at 25 weeks, and 77\% (n=448) at 26 weeks (P{$<$}0.001). At discharge from hospital, 68\% (n=705) of survivors had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (receiving supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age), 13\% (n=135) had evidence of serious abnormality on cerebral ultrasonography, and 16\% (n=166) had laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity. For babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation from March to December, the number of admissions for neonatal care increased by 44\%, from 666 in 1995 to 959 in 2006. By 2006 adherence to evidence based practice associated with improved outcome had significantly increased. Survival increased from 40\% to 53\% (P{$<$}0.001) overall and at each week of gestation: by 9.5\% (confidence interval -0.1\% to 19\%) at 23 weeks, 12\% (4\% to 20\%) at 24 weeks, and 16\% (9\% to 23\%) at 25 weeks. The proportions of babies surviving in 2006 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, major cerebral scan abnormality, or weight and/or head circumference {$<$}-2 SD were similar to those in 1995, but the proportion treated for retinopathy of prematurity had increased from 13\% to 22\% (P=0.006). Predictors of mortality and morbidity were similar in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: Survival of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation has increased since 1995 but the pattern of major neonatal morbidity and the proportion of survivors affected are unchanged. These observations reflect an important increase in the number of preterm survivors at risk of later health problems.},

  abstract = {This research investigated the speech, language, and functional auditory outcomes of 119 3-year-old children with hearing loss and additional disabilities. Outcomes were evaluated using direct assessment and caregiver report. Multiple regressions revealed that type of additional disability and level of maternal education were significant predictors of language outcomes. Poorer outcomes were achieved in a combined group of children with autism, cerebral palsy, and/or developmental delay (DD) (Group A), compared with children with vision or speech output impairments, syndromes not entailing DD, or medical disorders (Group B). Better outcomes were associated with higher levels of maternal education. The association between better language outcomes and earlier cochlear implant switch-on approached significance. Further regression analyses were conducted separately for children with different types of additional disabilities. Level of maternal education was the only significant predictor of outcomes for Group A children, whereas degree of hearing loss was the strongest predictor for children in Group B. The findings highlight the variable impact that different types of additional disabilities can have on language development in children with hearing loss.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined language development in young children with hearing loss and different types of additional disabilities (ADs). METHOD: A population-based cohort of 67 children who were enrolled in the Longitudinal Outcomes of Children with Hearing Impairment study took part. Language ability was directly assessed at 3 and 5~years of age using the Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition. Standard scores were used to enable comparison with age-based expectations for typically developing children. RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that, across the total cohort, children's language scores remained stable over the 2-year period. However, this overall stability masked a significant difference between children with different types of ADs; in particular, children with autism, cerebral palsy and/or developmental delay showed a decline in standard scores, whereas children with other disabilities showed a relative improvement. In addition, larger improvements in receptive vocabulary were associated with use of oral communication only. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that type of AD can be used to gauge expected language development in the population of children with hearing loss and ADs when formal assessment of cognitive ability is not feasible.},

SETTING: Infants were seen for developmental follow-up at 7, 13, and 26 months corrected age in the school of nursing. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 43 mothers and their preterm infants who were below 2,000 g and 36 weeks gestation at birth. More than 88\% of the sample were from lower social classes. Seventy-three percent of the sample was African American and 27\% was White. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Developmental outcome was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and language was assessed using the Reynell Developmental Language Scales. RESULTS: By 26 months corrected age, infant development was within the normal range. Expressive and receptive language was delayed an average of 3 to 5 months. Factors influencing language included length of hospital stay, birth weight, Apgar scores, infant irritability and state regulation at hospital discharge, and maternal sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Language development is delayed in preterm infants. Maternal sensitivity is positively associated with enhanced infant language. Nurses need to utilize opportunities to enhance sensitive mothering to optimize infant outcomes.},

In contrast, children with cochlear implants (CIs) are frequently encouraged to focus on a spoken language to the exclusion of sign language. Here, we investigate the spoken English language skills of 5 children with CIs who also have deaf signing parents, and so receive exposure to a full natural sign language (American Sign Language, ASL) from birth, in addition to spoken English after implantation. We compare their language skills with hearing ASL/English bilingual children of deaf parents. Our results show comparable English scores for the CI and hearing groups on a variety of standardized language measures, exceeding previously reported scores for children with CIs with the same age of implantation and years of CI use. We conclude that natural sign language input does no harm and may mitigate negative effects of early auditory deprivation for spoken language development. \textcopyright{} The Author 2013.

Method This cross-sectional study considered 53 children with bilateral hearing loss between 8 and 34 months of age ( M = 24, SD = 6.9). Demographic variables, variables related to the hearing loss, and intervention variables were included in a hierarchical regression analysis to predict expressive vocabulary quotients from the MacArthur Inventario del Desarrollo de Habilidades Comunicativas (Communicative Development Inventories; Jackson-Maldonado et al., 2003 ). Results Chronological age, degree of hearing loss, functional hearing ability ratings, age of enrollment in early intervention, and the interaction between chronological age and age of intervention accounted for 61.5\% of the vocabulary variance. Children who received intervention by 6 months of age achieved significantly higher vocabulary outcomes than children who started intervention later. Conclusion The children's mean vocabulary outcomes were below average when compared with hearing peers. This was especially true for older children, children with moderately-severe-to-profound hearing loss, and children who began intervention after 6 months of age. This delay in vocabulary outcomes has the potential to interfere with future reading and academic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The authors' purpose was to explore the nature of the link between hearing loss (HL) and language impairment in adolescents with mild-to-moderate hearing loss (MMHL). Does language performance (generally or in certain areas) normalize at adolescence? Method: The language skills of 19 French-speaking adolescents (ages 11-15) with moderate or mild sensorineural HL were evaluated via a series of tests assessing oral and written language, including an experimental probe, and compared with typically developing adolescents and adolescents with specific language impairment (SLI). Results: Language disorders were found, notably in the areas of phonology and grammar, in more than half the adolescents with MMHL; affected domains and error patterns were identical to those found in adolescents with SLI. Language scores of the adolescents with MMHL were significantly linked with degree of HL, a correlation not generally found in studies of children with MMHL. Conclusion: Normalization of language performance does not generalize at adolescence in the context of MMHL. The fact that an effect of the severity of HL was found only after childhood might be because linguistic development is basically complete at adolescence. Prior to this time, this effect could be obscured by developmental rhythms that vary from child to child. \textcopyright{} American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

The subjects' parents answered 10 questions about their communication patterns with their deaf child. The parents were not deaf themselves. Analysis of the data revealed that there is a positive relationship between the family's communication method and the deaf child's self-esteem such that parents who use total communication (speech, fingerspelling, and sign) have children whose self-esteem scores are higher than those of children whose parents use an oral-only method of communication (speech). The parents who were best able to communicate by using sign language had children whose self-esteem scores were higher than those of children whose parents were less skilled in sign language.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The advent of universal neonatal hearing screening in some countries and the availability of screening programs for at-risk infants in other countries has facilitated earlier referral, diagnosis, and intervention for infants with hearing loss. Improvements in device technology, two decades of pediatric clinical experience, a growing recognition of the efficacy of cochlear implants for young children, and the recent change in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's age criteria to include children as young as 12 mo has led to increasing numbers of young children receiving cochlear implants. Evidence to support provision for infants younger than 12 mo is extrapolated from physiological studies, studies of children using hearing aids, and studies of children older than 12 mo of age with implants. To date, however, there are few published research findings regarding communication development in children between 6 and 12 mo of age who receive implants. The current study hypothesized that earlier implantation would lead to increased rates of language acquisition as the children were still in the critical period for their development. METHOD: A retrospective review was completed for 19 infants (mean age at implantation, 0.88 yr; range, 0.61-1.07, SD 0.15) and 87 toddlers (mean age at implantation, 1.60 yr; range, 1.13-2.00, SD 0.24) who received the multichannel implant in Melbourne, Australia. Preimplantation audiological assessments for these children included aided and unaided audiograms, auditory brain stem response, auditory steady state response (ASSR), and otoacoustic emission and indicated profound to total bilateral hearing loss in all cases. Communication assessment included completion of the Rossetti Infant-Toddler Language Scale and educational psychologists' cognitive and motor assessment. Computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and surgical records for all cases were reviewed. Postimplantation language assessments were reported in terms of the rate of growth over time on the language comprehension and language expression subscales of the Rossetti Infant-Toddler Language Scale. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that cochlear implantation may be performed safely in very young children with excellent language outcomes. The mean rates of receptive (1.12) and expressive (1.01) language growth for children receiving implants before the age of 12 mo were significantly greater than the rates achieved by children receiving implants between 12 and 24 mo, and matched growth rates achieved by normally hearing peers. These preliminary results support the provision of cochlear implants for children younger than 12 mo of age within experienced pediatric implantation centers. \textcopyright{} 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

The children were presented with 20 nonword auditory patterns over a loudspeaker and were asked to repeat them aloud to the experimenter. The children's responses were recorded on digital audiotape and then played back to normal-hearing adult listeners to obtain accuracy ratings on a 7-point scale. The children's nonword repetition performance, as measured by these perceptual accuracy ratings, could be predicted in large part by their performance on independently collected measures of speech perception, verbal rehearsal speed, and speech production. The strongest contributing variable was speaking rate, which is widely argued to reflect verbal rehearsal speed in phonological working memory. Children who had become deaf at older ages received higher perceptual ratings. Children whose early linguistic experience and educational environments emphasized oral communication methods received higher perceptual ratings than children enrolled in total communication programs. The present findings suggest that individual differences in performance on nonword repetition are strongly related to variability observed in the component processes involved in language imitation tasks, including measures of speech perception, speech production, and especially verbal rehearsal speed in phonological working memory. In addition, onset of deafness at a later age and an educational environment emphasizing oral communication may be beneficial to the children's ability to develop the robust phonological processing skills necessary to accurately repeat novel, nonword sound patterns.},

The two instruments, one designed for 8-16-month-old infants, the other for 16-30-month-old toddlers, are both reliable and valid, confirming the value of parent reports that are based on contemporary behavior and a recognition format. Growth trends are described for children scoring at the 10th-, 25th-, 50th-, 75th-, and 90th-percentile levels on receptive and expressive vocabulary, actions and gestures, and a number of aspects of morphology and syntax. Extensive variability exists in the rate of lexical, gestural, and grammatical development. The wide variability across children in the time of onset and course of acquisition of these skills challenges the meaningfulness of the concept of the modal child. At the same time, moderate to high intercorrelations are found among the different skills both concurrently and predictively (across a 6-month period). Sex differences consistently favor females; however, these are very small, typically accounting for 1\%-2\% of the variance. The effects of SES and birth order are even smaller within this age range. The inventories offer objective criteria for defining typicality and exceptionality, and their cost effectiveness facilitates the aggregation of large data sets needed to address many issues of contemporary theoretical interest. The present data also offer unusually detailed information on the course of development of individual lexical, gestural, and grammatical items and features. Adaptations of the CDIs to other languages have opened new possibilities for cross-linguistic explorations of sequence, rate, and variability of communicative development.},

Of particular interest was the identification of biological and socioenvironmental risk and protective factors that influence VPT children's early language development.         Method:~         Data were collected as part of a prospective longitudinal study of 110 VPT (VPT: {$\leq$}33 weeks gestation) and 113 full-term children (full term: 37\textendash 41 weeks gestation) born in Canterbury, New Zealand from 1998 to 2000. At corrected age 4 years, all children were assessed with the preschool version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals.

Results:~         At the age of 4 years, VPT children were characterized by poorer receptive and expressive language development than full-term children. These differences persisted after exclusion of children with neurosensory impairment as well as statistical adjustment for the effects of social risk. Within the VPT group, the key predictors of children's overall language development were family social risk at birth (p =.05), severity of white matter abnormalities on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (p =.49), observed parent-child synchrony (p =.001), and concurrent child cognitive ability (p =.001). Together, these factors accounted for 45\% of the variance in children's total Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals\textemdash Preschool scores.         Conclusion:~         By preschool age, children born VPT show early emerging mild to moderate language delays that are likely to affect their school success and longer-term developmental progress. Findings highlight the importance of potentially modifiable factors such as early brain injury and parenting quality in predicting the language outcomes of children born VPT.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash textlessp\textbackslash textgreaterThis study examined whether children who are deaf acquire usable speech or continue to rely primarily on manual communication when they are enrolled in a total communication setting following receipt of a cochlear implant. Furthermore, it considered whether the use of speech post-implant is associated with other outcomes such as better speech perception skills, English language competence, speech intelligibility, and educational mainstreaming. Language samples were elicited from twenty- seven 8- and 9-year-olds who had received a Nucleus 22-channel cochlear implant before age 5 and were enrolled in a total communication program for at least the first 3 years following implantation. Samples were transcribed by mode of production (i.e., speech or sign) and scored for lexical diversity, syntax, utterance length, and use of bound morphemes. Results revealed a wide range of mode preference, with some children using primarily speech, some primarily sign, and some using both modes to varying extents. Not only did speech users achieve higher auditory speech perception scores and speech intelligibility ratings, but they also demonstrated better comprehension and use of English syntax than did children who used little or no speech. After 3 years with an implant, speech users were more likely than children who used little or no speech to be placed in mainstream educational programs.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most children with hearing loss who receive cochlear implants (CI) learn spoken language, and parents must choose early on whether to use sign language to accompany speech at home. We address whether parents' use of sign language before and after CI positively influences auditory-only speech recognition, speech intelligibility, spoken language, and reading outcomes. METHODS: Three groups of children with CIs from a nationwide database who differed in the duration of early sign language exposure provided in their homes were compared in their progress through elementary grades. The groups did not differ in demographic, auditory, or linguistic characteristics before implantation. RESULTS: Children without early sign language exposure achieved better speech recognition skills over the first 3 years postimplant and exhibited a statistically significant advantage in spoken language and reading near the end of elementary grades over children exposed to sign language. Over 70\% of children without sign language exposure achieved ageappropriate spoken language compared with only 39\% of those exposed for 3 or more years. Early speech perception predicted speech intelligibility in middle elementary grades. Children without sign language exposure produced speech that was more intelligible (mean = 70\%) than those exposed to sign language (mean = 51\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most compelling support yet available in CI literature for the benefits of spoken language input for promoting verbal development in children implanted by 3 years of age. Contrary to earlier published assertions, there was no advantage to parents' use of sign language either before or after CI.},

The prevalence of expressive language delays in children with Down syndrome highlights the need to develop early interventions to promote language development. The existing literature on the usefulness of Total Communication as an intervention method with children and adults with special needs is documented and a rationale for the use of Total Communication with children with Down syndrome is presented. In the case study, a single subject simultaneous treatment design was used which involved introducing 20 words during free play (10 oral and 10 Total Communication), which were matched on phonetic complexity and reinforcement value. Results indicated that comprehension was not differentially affected by the type of communication approach used. However, expressively the child was able to use manual signs many months before any understandable words were produced. The use of manual signs did not inhibit use of speech. The results of this case study suggest that the early use of Total Communication can be an effective transitional mode of communication for at least some children with Down syndrome. Further research is needed to explore individual differences between children with Down syndrome and to identify factors that predict those children who benefit most from the use of Total Communication.},

Language development can be particularly impacted by social factors, as seen in the developmental choices made for deaf children which can create language deprivation. A possible mental health syndrome may be present in deaf patients with severe language deprivation. Methods Electronic databases were searched to identify publications focusing on language development and mental health in the deaf population. Screening of relevant publications narrowed the search results to 35 publications. Results Although there is very limited empirical evidence, there appears to be suggestions of a mental health syndrome by clinicians working with deaf patients. Possible features include language dysfluency, fund of knowledge deficits, and disruptions in thinking, mood, and/or behavior. Conclusion The clinical specialty of deaf mental health appears to be struggling with a clinically observed phenomenon that has yet to be empirically investigated and defined within the DSM-5. Descriptions of patients within the clinical setting suggest a language deprivation syndrome. Language development experiences have an epidemiological relationship with psychiatric outcomes in deaf people. This requires more empirical attention and has implications for other populations with behavioral health disparities as well.},

Despite evidence that natural sign languages are beneficial to DHH children, many researchers and practitioners advise families to focus exclusively on spoken language. We critique the Pediatrics article 'Early Sign Language Exposure and Cochlear Implants' (Geers et al., 2017) as an example of research that makes unsupported claims against the inclusion of natural sign languages. We refute claims that (1) there are harmful effects of sign language and (2) that listening and spoken language are necessary for optimal development of deaf children. While practical challenges remain (and are discussed) for providing a sign language-rich environment, research evidence suggests that such challenges are worth tackling in light of natural sign languages providing a host of benefits for DHH children-especially in the prevention and reduction of language deprivation.},

  abstract = {Objective~         In 1993, 11 hospitals in the United States were known to screen more than 90\% of newborns for hearing loss. By 2000, approximately 1000 hospitals reported screening at least 90\% of their babies. This study was designed to identify trends in the age of identification and intervention for infants and young children with hearing loss in light of expanded implementation of newborn hearing screening.         Design~         Parents of children under 6 yr of age with a confirmed hearing loss were surveyed. The survey instrument was designed to investigate three questions: 1) is the age of identification and intervention earlier for babies whose hearing is screened at birth compared with those whose hearing is not screened; 2) when hearing is screened at birth, do ages of dia-gnosis of hearing loss and intervention meet the guide-lines established in 2000, by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (Reference Note 1), and 3) what are the barriers to timely identification and intervention? Six hundred fifty-seven parents received the mailing.         Results~         Responses of 151 parents of children with hearing loss, born between 1996 and 2000, were analyzed. Parents from 41 states provided information. Approximately half the children reported on were screened for hearing loss at birth. Age of identification and hearing aid fitting varied substantially based on degree of hearing loss and whether the cause of hearing loss was known or unknown; however, diagnosis and intervention occurred at an earlier age for infants screened at birth. Findings indicate that when hearing is screened at birth, infants with more severe degrees of hearing loss and an unknown cause tend to be identified and receive intervention within the 2000 timelines proposed by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing. Barriers to timely identification and intervention are discussed.         Conclusions~         Before widespread implementation of newborn hearing screening, age of identification and intervention were consistently reported to exceed 2 yr of age. The results reported here indicate a trend toward earlier identification and hearing aid fitting with the implementation of newborn hearing screening. Although limited to literate and English speaking respondents, the study provides supporting evidence that newborn hearing screening lowers the ages of identification and intervention.},

The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the benefit of cochlear implantation in children with UHL in comparison to their unaided listening situation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective repeated measures single subject design. SETTING: Tertiary referral center; cochlear implant (CI) program PATIENTS: Three children (4, 10, and 11 yr) with noncongenital UHL resulting from different causes were enrolled in the study. INTERVENTION: After extensive consultation with each family and confirming CI-candidacy, each child received a cochlear implant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Open set speech recognition measures in competing background noise and tests of sound localization were performed for unaided preoperative and CI-aided postimplant intervals after 6 and 12 months. The parent and child versions of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities scale (SSQ) were used for subjective evaluation of hearing at preimplant and 12-month postimplant intervals. CONCLUSION: All children consistently use their CI 1 year postimplant. Our preliminary results suggest binaural hearing benefits for speech understanding in noise, localization ability and subjectively perceived hearing ability for school-aged children with UHL. Trends for CI-benefits in younger preschoolaged children are confirmed through subjective assessment reported by the parents. The benefits in hearing performance suggest binaural integration and processing of electric and acoustic stimulation arriving at 2 different ears is possible for children with UHL.},

Analysis of the scores showed that children enrolled in oral-only habilitation programs scored significantly higher on the speech perception measures than did children who were enrolled in total communication based programs. These results were inconsistent with those of other reports, which suggested that communication methods had little effect on implant outcomes. To further examine the reasons for the differences in performance, we analyzed 7 additional factors, including length of implant use, age at surgery, device type, socioeconomic status, bilingualism, school setting, and participation in private therapy, which may affect implant performance. Multiple-regression analysis again showed communication mode to be the factor most highly correlated with speech perception abilities among this group of children.},

Methods: Receptive and expressive language outcomes of a sample of 63 children (mean age 5;1 years) with hearing loss (mean 78. dB, SD 25.3) enrolled in the only specific early intervention program in Upper Austria were assessed. The sample can be regarded as representative for children with significant hearing loss. For 89\% the hearing loss was congenital. Language results were related to age at diagnosis, age at first fitting of hearing aids and age at enrolment in the intervention program. Confounding variables such as IQ, degree of hearing loss and family parameters were controlled for in regression analyses. Results: Early commencement of family centred intervention had a significant impact on language outcomes as opposed to age at diagnosis and age at fitting of hearing aids. Conclusion: In managing intervention in children with hearing loss, time between diagnosis and onset of early intervention should be kept as short as possible. However, age of entry to early intervention explained only about 4\% of the variance in language outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

In this study we characterize vocabulary growth rates for each of 22 children by using data obtained at several time points from 14 to 26 months. We find a substantial relation between individual differences in vocabulary acquisition and variations in the amount that particular mothers speak to their children. The relation between amount of parent speech and vocabulary growth, we argue, reflects parent effects on the child, rather than child-ability effects on the parent or hereditary factors. We also find that gender is an important factor in rate of vocabulary growth.},

  abstract = {Objective. Ninety percent of all newborns in the United States are now screened for hearing loss before they leave the hospital. Many hospitals use a 2-stage protocol for newborn hearing screening in which all infants are screened first with otoacoustic emissions (OAE). No additional testing is done with infants who pass the OAE, but infants who fail the OAE next are screened with automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR). Infants who fail the A-ABR screening are referred for diagnostic testing to determine whether they have permanent hearing loss (PHL). Those who pass the A-ABR are considered at low risk for hearing loss and are not tested further. The objective of this multicenter study was to determine whether a substantial number of infants who fail the initial OAE and pass the A-ABR have PHL at {$\sim$}9 months of age. Methods. Seven birthing centers with successful newborn hearing screening programs using a 2-stage OAE/A-ABR screening protocol participated. During the study period, 86634 infants were screened for hearing loss at these sites. Of those infants who failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR in at least 1 ear, 1524 were enrolled in the study. Data about prenatal, neonatal, and socioeconomic factors, plus hearing loss risk indicators, were collected for all enrolled infants. When the infants were an average of 9.7 months of age, diagnostic audiologic evaluations were done for 64\% of the enrolled infants (1432 ears from 973 infants). Results. Twenty-one infants (30 ears) who had failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR during the newborn hearing screening were identified with permanent bilateral or unilateral hearing loss. Twenty-three (77\%) of the ears had mild hearing loss (average of 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz {$\leq$}40-decibel hearing level). Nine (43\%) infants had bilateral as opposed to unilateral loss, and 18 (86\%) infants had sensorineural as opposed to permanent conductive hearing loss. Conclusions. If all infants were screened for hearing loss using the 2-stage OAE/A-ABR newborn hearing screening protocol currently used in many hospitals, then {$\sim$}23\% of those with PHL at {$\sim$}9 months of age would have passed the A-ABR. This happens in part because much of the A-ABR screening equipment in current use was designed to identify infants with moderate or greater hearing loss. Thus, program administrators should be certain that the screening program, equipment, and protocols are designed to identify the type of hearing loss targeted by their program. The results also show the need for continued surveillance of hearing status during childhood.},

The authors present an analysis of the demographics of deaf and hard-of-hearing children in various K-12 educational settings in the US, with a brief review of how this profile has changed over the last 3 decades. To begin, the authors place the academic achievement patterns among deaf and hard-of-hearing students in the context of variations in outcomes among hearing students. Next, the authors compare hearing students and deaf and hard-of-hearing students by reviewing the results from the 1996 Stanford Achievement Test, ninth edition. Finally, the authors present a synthesis of what is known about the link between student characteristics and achievement outcomes among program settings.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with bilateral permanent hearing impairment often have impaired language and speech abilities. However, the effects of universal newborn screening for permanent bilateral childhood hearing impairment and the effects of confirmation of hearing impairment by nine months of age on subsequent verbal abilities are uncertain. METHODS: We studied 120 children with bilateral permanent hearing impairment identified from a large birth cohort in southern England, at a mean of 7.9 years of age. Of the 120 children, 61 were born during periods with universal newborn screening and 57 had hearing impairment that was confirmed by nine months of age. The primary outcomes were language as compared with nonverbal ability and speech expressed as z scores (the number of standard deviations by which the score differed from the mean score among 63 age-matched children with normal hearing), adjusted for the severity of the hearing impairment and for maternal education. RESULTS: Confirmation of hearing impairment by nine months of age was associated with higher adjusted mean z scores for language as compared with nonverbal ability (adjusted mean difference for receptive language, 0.82; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 1.33; and adjusted mean difference for expressive language, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 1.26). Birth during periods with universal newborn screening was also associated with higher adjusted z scores for receptive language as compared with nonverbal ability (adjusted mean difference, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 1.13), although the z scores for expressive language as compared with nonverbal ability were not significantly higher. Speech scores did not differ significantly between those who were exposed to newborn screening or early confirmation and those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of childhood hearing impairment was associated with higher scores for language but not for speech in midchildhood.

During a 4-year-period in a defined geographical area of Germany (Lower Saxony), 31 children were carefully audiologically and psychologically examined at the Department of Phoniatrics/Pedaudiology, University of G\"ottingen. All children were fitted unilaterally with a hearing aid. The HI was mild in 3\%, moderate in 23\%, severe in 29\% and profound in 45\% of the cases. The hearing defect was congenital in 23\%, post-natally acquired in 16\%, and of unknown onset in 61\% of the cases. The affected side was the right in 17 cases, and the left in 14. The mean age at ascertainment was 65.5 months (SD 25.5; median 70). According to parental judgement, nearly 81\% of the children had accepted their hearing aid (based on the daily/weekly time for which the child was using the hearing aid). On average, the children scored in the normal range in standardized non-verbal intelligence tests. They were delayed in using two-word phrases (on average for 5 months), but not in using their first words. However, children with USNHI experienced no more difficulty on standardized linguistic tasks than normally hearing subjects of the same age and gender.},

METHOD: All children aged between 2;6 to 6;3 years diagnosed in the Department of Phoniatrics/Pedaudiology of the University Gottingen as having a permanent bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment ("Gottinger Hor-Sprachregister") in a defined period (july 1995-september 2000) were examined with standardized receptive and expressive vocabulary tests as well as a nonverbal intelligence test (on average 5.5 months after diagnosis and 2.9 months after fitting with hearing aids). SAMPLE: 37 children (20 boys, 17 girls). Mean age at diagnosis: 48.5 (SD 15.9; min. 18, max. 75) months, mean age at hearing aid fitting: 51 months (SD 15.2). Multiple handicapped children, children with additional conductive hearing impairment and those with postnatal losses were excluded. The sample as a whole demonstrated lexical deficits of varying severity that were greater in the expressive than in the receptive vocabulary, depending on the clinical parameter. Children with congenital hearing impairment, with severe-to-profound hearing impairment (\textbackslash textgreater 70 dB) and bilingual children demonstrated on average the smallest receptive and expressive vocabulary. An early fitting with hearing aids did not correspond with a better lexical development when a severe-to-profound hearing impairment existed. Severity of a hearing impairment and nonverbal intelligence significantly predicted the average size of the receptive vocabulary. A moderate hearing impairment, high non-verbal intelligence, and gender (female) emerged as the strongest significant predictors of the expressive vocabulary. The vocabulary test result of a bilateral sensorineurally hearing-impaired child may be an indicator for early cognitive training.},

CCS is a rare genetic disorder, with an estimated incidence between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 50,000 births, resulting from a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. In general, individuals have delayed speech and language development, and some never develop spoken language. Their receptive language is better than their expressive language, although both are delayed. Regarding phonetics and phonology, substitutions, omissions, and distortions are frequent; consonant inventories are small; syllable shapes are restricted; and vowels are variable and overlap with each other acoustically. Persons with CCS have been found to inflect words from all major word classes. Little is known about syntactic skills, but some individuals are reported to express themselves in utterances of two or more words. Knowledge about speech and language development in CCS is sparse, and the need for more research is considerable.},

  abstract = {Around 96 percent of children with hearing loss are born to parents with intact hearing, who may initially know little about deafness or sign language. Therefore, such parents will need information and support in making decisions about the medical, linguistic, and educational management of their child. Some of these decisions are time-sensitive and irreversible and come at a moment of emotional turmoil and vulnerability (when some parents grieve the toss of a normally hearing child). Clinical research indicates that a deaf child's poor communication skills can be made worse by increased level of parental depression. Given this, the importance of reliable and up-to-date support for parents' decisions is critical to the overall well-being of their child. In raising and educating a child, parents are often offered an exclusive choice between an oral environment (including assistive technology, speech reading, and voicing) and a signing environment. A heated controversy surrounds this choice, and has since at least the late 19th century, beginning with the International Congress on the Education of the Deaf in Milan, held in 1880. While families seek advice from many sources, including, increasingly, the internet, the primary care physician (PCP) is the professional medical figure the family interacts with repeatedly., The present article aims to help family advisors, particularly the PCP and other medical advisors in this regard. We argue that deaf children need to be exposed regularly and frequently to good language models in both visual and auditory modalities from the time hearing loss is detected and continued throughout their education to ensure proper cognitive, psychological, and educational development. Since there is, unfortunately, a dearth of empirical studies on many of the issues families must confront, professional opinions, backed by what studies do exist, are the only option. We here give our strongly held professional opinions and stress the need for improved research studies in these areas.},

Higher youth perception of their ability to understand parents' communication was significantly correlated with perceived quality of life as well as lower reported depressive symptoms and lower perceived stigma. Youth who use speech as their single mode of communication were more likely to report greater stigma associated with being DHH than youth who used both speech and sign.

A total of 29 deaf children (7-8. years of age at the first assessment) participated in the study, and every 12. months they were given a battery of literacy, cognitive, and language tasks. Earlier vocabulary and speechreading skills predicted longitudinal growth in reading achievement. The relations between reading and the predictor variables showed developmental change. Earlier reading ability was related to later phonological awareness skills, suggesting that deaf children might develop their phonological awareness through reading. Deaf children who had the most age-appropriate reading skills tended to have less severe hearing losses and earlier diagnoses and also preferred to communicate through speech. The theoretical implications of the role for speechreading, vocabulary and phonological awareness in deaf children's literacy are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In the current study, we examined sex differences in language competence in terms of mean values and variance in large samples (N \textbackslash textgreater 10,000) of German children aged 3-6 years. We administered several tests to assess the children's vocabulary, grammar, speech comprehension, pronunciation, and the processing of sentences and nonce words. Girls performed better than boys in all domains, most often to a statistically significant degree, although the effect sizes were small. Differences decreased with age. Boys varied significantly more than girls in their language competence. In response, we discuss explanations for these findings, as well as recommend directions for future research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past, unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in children was thought to have little consequence because speech and language presumably developed appropriately with one normal-hearing ear. Some studies from the 1980s and 1990s have suggested that a significantly increased proportion of children with UHL may have educational and/or behavioral problems, compared with their normal-hearing peers. Limited data exist about the effect of UHL on acquisition of speech and language skills. OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature about the impact UHL has on the development of speech and language and educational achievement. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search between 1966 and June 1, 2003, using the medical subject heading "hearing loss," combined with the textword "unilateral." STUDY SELECTION: Studies were limited to those written in English, reporting speech-language and/or educational results in children. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were read with attention to study design, population, recruitment of subjects, and outcomes measured. DATA SYNTHESIS: Problems in school included a 22\% to 35\% rate of repeating at least one grade, and 12\% to 41\% receiving additional educational assistance. Speech and language delays have been reported in some but not all studies. CONCLUSIONS: School-age children with UHL appear to have increased rates of grade failures, need for additional educational assistance, and perceived behavioral issues in the classroom. Speech and language delays may occur in some children with UHL, but it is unclear if children "catch up" as they grow older. Research into this area is necessary to clarify these issues and to determine whether interventions may prevent potential problems.},

This review summarizes the outcomes of a large study of children with UHL which identified risk factors for educational problems, describes the results of pilot studies of intervention, and proposes guidelines for interventions and future studies. Methods: Cohort of children age 6-12 years with UHL was compared to their siblings with normal hearing on the primary outcomes of cognition, achievement, and language. Secondary outcomes examined included behavioral, speech, and educational problems. A subgroup of children with UHL was followed longitudinally to examine change over time. Results: Children with UHL had lower language and verbal IQ scores than their siblings with normal hearing. They required individualized education plans (a measure of educational difficulty) at three times the rate and speech therapy at twice the rate of their siblings. The additional educational concerns did not ameliorate over time. Low maternal education levels and lower baseline cognitive skills were independent risk factors for school problems. Pilot studies suggest that children with UHL might benefit from amplification, but may need attention to cognitive or executive function skills as well. Conclusions: Children with UHL are at risk for delays in speech-language development, cognition, and behavioral problems that can affect functioning at school. Controlled studies are urgently needed to determine whether amplification, auditory rehabilitation, school-provided educational assistance, or other interventions are able to reduce or eliminate this risk.},

We assessed whether cochlear implantation in both ears (bilateral implantation) is associated with better listening skills, higher health-related quality of life (health utility) and higher general quality of life (QOL) than unilateral implantation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: University of York. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty severely-profoundly deaf and 56 normally-hearing children recruited via a charity, the UK National Health Service and schools. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty of the deaf children had received bilateral cochlear implants; 20 had unilateral cochlear implants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Performance measures of children's listening skills; parental-proxy valuations of the deaf children's health utility obtained with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and of their QOL obtained with a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: On average, bilaterally-implanted children performed significantly better than unilaterally implanted children on tests of sound localisation and speech perception in noise. After conservative imputation of missing data and while controlling for confounds, bilateral implantation was associated with increases of 18.5\% in accuracy of sound localisation (95\% CI 5.9 to 31.1) and of 3.7 dB in speech perception in noise (95\% CI 0.9 to 6.5). Bilaterally-implanted children did not perform as well as normally-hearing children, on average. Bilaterally- and unilaterally-implanted children did not differ significantly in parental ratings of health utility (difference in medians 0.05, p{$>$}0.05) or QOL (difference in medians 0.01, p{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with unilateral cochlear implantation, bilateral implantation is associated with better listening skills in severely-profoundly deaf children.},

  abstract = {The Chi-square statistic is a non-parametric (distribution free) tool designed to analyze group differences when the dependent variable is measured at a nominal level. Like all non-parametric statistics, the Chi-square is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. Specifically, it does not require equality of variances among the study groups or homoscedasticity in the data. It permits evaluation of both dichotomous independent variables, and of multiple group studies. Unlike many other non-parametric and some parametric statistics, the calculations needed to compute the Chi-square provide considerable information about how each of the groups performed in the study. This richness of detail allows the researcher to understand the results and thus to derive more detailed information from this statistic than from many others., The Chi-square is a significance statistic, and should be followed with a strength statistic. The Cramer's V is the most common strength test used to test the data when a significant Chi-square result has been obtained. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies. Limitations include its sample size requirements, difficulty of interpretation when there are large numbers of categories (20 or more) in the independent or dependent variables, and tendency of the Cramer's V to produce relative low correlation measures, even for highly significant results.},

The epidemiologic parameters of hearing impairment in the United States have not been systematically studied and important historic data have not diffused to relevant stakeholders; even otolaryngologists are unfamiliar with epidemiologic data. We wished to compile known studies to establish an epidemiologic baseline beginning with pediatric data., Data Sources: Relevant literature was retrieved from medical databases and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports., Methods: Candidate articles and national data sets encompassing pediatric hearing loss were analyzed and compared. Whenever possible, group analyses were performed., Results: The average incidence of neonatal hearing loss in the United States is 1.1 per 1000 infants, with variation among states (0.22 to 3.61 per 1000). Childhood and adolescent prevalence rates demonstrate variability. The prevalence of mild hearing impairment or worse ({$>$}20 dB) is 3.1 percent based on the average of comparable audiometric screening studies; self-reporting prevalence is 1.9 percent. Hispanic Americans demonstrate a higher prevalence of hearing impairment than other children. Low-income households demonstrate a higher prevalence of hearing loss compared to households with higher income levels. Genetic causes were attributed to 23 percent across studies., Conclusions: Analysis of the data reveals gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of hearing loss and stresses the importance of consistent definitions of hearing impairment for systematic assessment of changes over time. Hearing loss in childhood deserves further epidemiologic investigation and elevated awareness among health care professionals and the public. Genetic etiologies are likely underestimated in this review.},

Unfortunately, children with additional disabilities receiving CIs have largely been excluded from studies on cochlear implant outcomes. Thus limited data exists on outcomes in this population to guide pre-implant counseling for anticipated benefits. The study objectives were: (1) evaluate differences in post-cochlear implant language skills between children with cochlear implants and developmental disabilities and age/cognitively matched controls; (2) quantify possible discrepancies between language level and cognitive level. Fifteen children with a developmental disability who received a CI were matched 1:1 on nonverbal cognitive ability and age to hearing controls. Language was evaluated using Preschool Language Scale-IV and reported as language quotients. Multivariable mixed models for matched pairs analyzed differences in language levels between groups. No significant differences were seen between CI and control groups regarding insurance, maternal education, or family income level. Results of the multivariable models indicated that compared to matched controls, the CI group had significantly lower mean receptive (24.6 points, p= 0.002) and mean expressive (21.9 points, p= 0.001) language quotients after controlling for confounders such as number of therapies and weekly hours in therapy. Significant discrepancies between language level and cognitive level were seen among CI participants only. Compared to age- and cognitively matched controls, children with CIs had significantly lower language levels with delays disproportionate to their cognitive potential. Mechanisms behind this performance-functional gap need to be understood to deliver appropriate intervention strategies for this special population. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose of this article is to summarize research and directions for future research with regard to two questions related to the delivery of AAC supports to these individuals: (a) What AAC modality is preferable to use? and (b) What do we know about the use of voice output communication aids with people with autism? KEY WORDS: autism, manual signing, aided communication , augmentative and alternative communication tion supports to students with autism and related disorders. It is estimated that one third to one half of children and adults with autism do not use speech functionally (National Research Council, 2001). Thus, many individuals with autism are candidates for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, either to supplement (i.e., augment) their existing speech or to act as their primary (i.e., alternative) method of expressive communication. Although there is a growing a body of research regarding the potential of AAC for students with autism (see Mirenda, 2001, and Schlosser \& Blischak, 2001, for recent reviews), many questions in this area remain unanswered. The purpose of this article is to summarize, in narrative form, what we know, what we do not know, and directions for future research with regard to two questions that are frequently asked by speech-language pathologists who provide support to these students: \textbullet{} Are unaided AAC approaches such as manual signs or aided AAC approaches such as photographs and line drawings preferable for use with students with autism? \textbullet{} What do we know about the use of voice output communication aids (VOCAs, also known as speech-generating devices) with students with autism? In order to accomplish this, existing research was reviewed along content rather than methodological parameters. Stringent criteria such as those typically used in a meta-analysis to evaluate the adequacy of various research methodologies were not applied. Rather, the research was reviewed at face value, under the assumption that all of the studies had adequate internal validity that led to empirically sound outcomes. This approach is admittedly more subjective and less conservative than a more formal meta-analytic approach; hence, the conclusions should be taken as suggestive rather than definitive. Nonetheless, this narrative review should provide preliminary guidelines for},

The prevalence of deaf children born to deaf parents (deaf-of-deaf ) is important because it is often cited when describing linguistic and educational advantages, along with social and cultural differences, associated with deaf children born to deaf parents compared to deaf children of hearing parents. This analysis provides a current estimate for the distribution of parental hearing status among deaf and hard of hearing students in United States using data from the Annual Survey of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children and Youth (1999-2000). This is the first national estimate that fully utilizes the distinction between children having deaf parents and hard of hearing parents, as well as hearing parents. The authors propose that the key demographic to report, other than that the overwhelming majority of deaf and hard of hearing students have hearing parents, is whether the child has one or two deaf parents. The annual survey findings indicate that less than five percent of deaf and hard of hearing students receiving special education are known to have at least one deaf parent, which is less than half of the presumed ten percent. Reasons for the difference between the present and previous estimates are suggested. (Contains 5 tables, 2 figures and 11 notes.)},

A related goal is to identify gaps in the empirical literature and suggest future research directions. Included in the language development review are studies of semantics (vocabulary, novel word learning, and conceptual categories), morphology, and syntax. The literacy section begins by considering dimensions of literacy and the ways in which hearing impairment may influence them. It is followed by a discussion of existing evidence on reading and writing, and highlights key constructs that need to be addressed for a comprehensive understanding of literacy in these children. \textcopyright{} 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Objective: By age three, typically developing children have achieved extensive vocabulary and syntax skills that facilitate both cognitive and social development. Substantial delays in spoken language acquisition have been documented for children with severe-profound deafness, even those with auditory oral training and early hearing aid use. This study documents the spoken language skills achieved by orally educated three-year-olds whose profound hearing loss was identified and hearing aids fitted between 1 and 30 months of age and who received a cochlear implant between 12 and 38 months of age. The purpose of the analysis was to examine the effects of age, duration and type of early auditory experience on spoken language competence at age 3.5. Design: The spoken language skills of 76 children who had used a cochlear implant for at least 7 months were evaluated via standardized 30-minute language sample analysis, a parent-completed vocabulary checklist, and a teacher language-rating scale. The children were recruited from and enrolled in oral education programs or therapy practices across the United States. Inclusion criteria included: presumed deaf since birth, English the primary language of the home, no other known conditions that interfere with speech/language development, enrolled in programs using oral education methods, and no known problems with the cochlear implant lasting over 30 days. Results: Strong correlations were obtained among all language measures. Therefore, principal components analysis was used to derive a single Language Factor score for each child. A number of possible predictors of language outcome were examined, including age at identification and intervention with a hearing aid, duration of use of a hearing aid, pre-implant PTA threshold with a hearing aid, PTA threshold with a cochlear implant, and duration of use of a cochlear implant/ age at implantation (the last two variables were practically identical since all children were tested between 40 and 44 months of age). Examination of the independent influence of these predictors through multiple regression analysis revealed that pre-implant aided PTA threshold and duration of CI use (i.e., age at implant) accounted for 58\% of the variance in Language Factor scores. A significant negative coefficient associated with pre-implant aided threshold indicated that children with poorer hearing before implantation exhibited poorer language skills at age 3.5 years. Likewise, a strong positive coefficient associated with duration of implant use indicated that children who had used their implant for a longer period of time (i.e., who were implanted at an earlier age) exhibited better language at age 3.5 years. Age at identification and amplification was unrelated to language outcome, as was aided threshold with the cochlear implant. A significant quadratic trend in the relation between duration of implant use and language score revealed a steady increase in language skill (at age 3.5) for each additional month of use of a cochlear implant after the first 12 months of implant use. The advantage to language of longer implant use became more pronounced over time. Conclusions: Longer use of a cochlear implant in infancy and very early childhood dramatically affects the amount of spoken language exhibited by three year old profoundly deaf children. In this sample, the amount of pre-implant intervention with a hearing aid was not related to language outcome at 3.5 years of age. Rather, it was cochlear implantation at a younger age that served to promote spoken language competence. The previously identified language-facilitating factors of early identification of hearing impairment and early educational intervention may not be sufficient for optimizing spoken language of profoundly deaf children unless it leads to early cochlear implantation.},

  abstract = {Context: Cochlear implantation is a surgical alternative to traditional amplification (hearing aids) that can facilitate spoken language development in young children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Objective: To prospectively assess spoken language acquisition following cochlear implantation in young children. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective, longitudinal, and multidimensional assessment of spoken language development over a 3-year period in children who underwent cochlear implantation before 5 years of age (n=188) from 6 US centers and hearing children of similar ages (n=97) from 2 preschools recruited between November 2002 and December 2004. Follow-up completed between November 2005 and May 2008. Main Outcome Measures: Performance on measures of spoken language comprehension and expression (Reynell Developmental Language Scales). Results: Children undergoing cochlear implantation showed greater improvement in spoken language performance (10.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-11.2 points per year in comprehension; 8.4; 95\% CI, 7.8-9.0 in expression) than would be predicted by their preimplantation baseline scores (5.4; 95\% CI, 4.1-6.7, comprehension; 5.8; 95\% CI, 4.6-7.0, expression), although mean scores were not restored to age-appropriate levels after 3 years. Younger age at cochlear implantation was associated with significantly steeper rate increases in comprehension (1.1; 95\% CI, 0.5-1.7 points per year younger) and expression (1.0; 95\% CI, 0.6-1.5 points per year younger). Similarly, each 1-year shorter history of hearing deficit was associated with steeper rate increases in comprehension (0.8; 95\% CI, 0.2-1.2 points per year shorter) and expression (0.6; 95\% CI, 0.2-1.0 points per year shorter). In multivariable analyses, greater residual hearing prior to cochlear implantation, higher ratings of parent-child interactions, and higher socioeconomic status were associated with greater rates of improvement in comprehension and expression. Conclusion: The use of cochlear implants in young children was associated with better spoken language learning than would be predicted from their preimplantation scores. \textcopyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Speech perception after implantation can vary widely - we have analysed the contribution of several factors. Methods. We examined 40 children with mean age at implantation of 52 months who were either born deaf or became deaf before 3 years. All patients received the same multichannel implant system and were followed up for 5 years. We used connected discourse tracking (CDT) as the measure of speech perception. The effect of five potential predictors (age at implantation, number of inserted electrodes, origin of deafness, mode of communication, and socioeconomic group) on speech perception was analysed. Findings. The mean number of words per minute perceived increased from 0 before implantation to 44.8 (SD 24.3) 5 years after implantation. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that children significantly progressed over time (p = 0.001). Age at implantation was a significant covariate (p = 0.01) and mode of communication was a significant between-individuals factor (p = 0.04). Interpretation. Young age at intervention and oral communication mode are the most important known determinants of later speech perception in young children after cochlear implantation. Early identification of candidate children necessitates implementation of universal neonatal screening programmes for hearing impairment.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The present study seeks to describe and analyze the syntactic features of children with severely hearing loss who had access to the hearing aids compared with children with normal hearing, assigning them to the same separate gender classes. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present study, eight children with severe hearing impairment who used a hearing aid and eight hearing children matched for age and gender were selected using an available sampling method based on the principles of auditory-verbal approach. Hearing children had an average age of 5.45 {$\pm$}1.9 years and subjects had a mean age of 5.43{$\pm$}2.17 years and their rehabilitation had begun before they were 18 months old. The assessment instrument of the study included the language development test, TOLDP-3. The syntactic skills of these children were analyzed and compared with the hearing children of the same age based on gender. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the syntactic scores of the hearing-impaired children and the scores of the hearing children of the same age in the "sentence imitation" (t=-2/90, P\textbackslash textless0/05) and "grammatical completion" (t=-3/39, P\textbackslash textless0/05) subtests, with no significant difference in the "grammatical understanding" subtest (t=1/67, P\textbackslash textgreater0/05). Moreover, there was no significant difference between male and female children with hearing impairment in terms of syntactic skills development. CONCLUSION With early diagnosis and timely rehabilitating intervention, children with hearing loss can perform in a similar way to children of their age with normal hearing in some syntactical areas. Furthermore, the gender factor in the present study had no effect on the development of syntactical skills of children with hearing loss.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the auditory and speech outcome in deaf children with deaf parents (CDP) after cochlear implantation (CI), emphasizing both the presence of additional caregiver and patients' main communication mode. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. SETTING: Cochlear implant center at a tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Fourteen CDP and 14 age- and sex-matched deaf children with normal-hearing parents (CNH). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Korean version of Ling's stage (K-Ling) and Category of Auditory Perception (CAP) were administered to the children to assess the speech production and auditory perception abilities, preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after CI. To elucidate the effects of the additional caregiver and main communication mode of the implanted child, the patients were divided into the following groups: with additional caregiver(s) who have normal hearing (n = 11) versus without additional caregiver (n = 3); sign language plus oral communication (S+O) group (n = 9) versus oral communication only (O) group (n = 5). RESULTS: CAP scores and K-Ling stages improved remarkably in both CDP and CNH, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. Within the CDP group, CAP scores and K-Ling stages improved significantly in CDP with an additional caregiver than those without. Auditory perception and speech production performances in the S+O group were similar to those in the O group. CONCLUSION: CDP can develop similarly to CNH in auditory perception and speech production, if an additional caregiver with normal hearing provides sufficient support and speech input. In addition, using sign language in addition to oral language might not be harmful, and these children can be a communication bridge between their deaf parents and society.},

  abstract = {What aspects of word meaning are important in early word learning and lexico-semantic network development? Adult lexico-semantic systems flexibly encode multiple types of semantic features, including: functional, perceptual, taxonomic, and encyclopedic. However, various theoretical accounts of lexical development differ on whether and how these semantic properties of word meanings are initially encoded into young children's emerging lexico-semantic networks. While some accounts highlight the importance of early perceptual vs. conceptual properties, others posit that thematic or functional aspects of word meaning are primary relative to taxonomic knowledge. We seek to shed light on these debates with two modeling studies that explore patterns in early word learning using a large database of early vocabulary in 5450 children, and a newly developed set of semantic features of early-acquired nouns. In study 1, we ask whether semantic properties of early-acquired words relate to order in which these words are typically learned and study 2 models normative lexico-semantic noun-feature network development compared to random network growth. Both studies provide converging evidence that perceptual properties of word meanings play a key role in early word learning and lexico-semantic network development. The findings lend support to theoretical accounts of language learning that highlight the importance of the child's perceptual experience.},

Design Population based cohort studies, EPIPAGE and EPIPAGE-2. Setting France. Participants 5567 neonates born alive in 2011 at 22-34 completed weeks' gestation, with 4199 survivors at 2 years corrected age included in follow-up. Comparison of outcomes reported for 3334 (1997) and 2418 (2011) neonates born alive in the nine regions participating in both studies. Main outcome measures Survival; cerebral palsy (2000 European consensus definition); scores below threshold on the neurodevelopmental Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ; at least one of five domains below threshold) if completed between 22 and 26 months corrected age, in children without cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness; and survival without severe or moderate neuromotor or sensory disabilities (cerebral palsy with Gross Motor Function Classification System levels 2-5, unilateral or bilateral blindness or deafness). Results are given as percentage of outcome measures with 95\% confidence intervals. Results Among 5170 liveborn neonates with parental consent, survival at 2 years corrected age was 51.7\% (95\% confidence interval 48.6\% to 54.7\%) at 22-26 weeks' gestation, 93.1\% (92.1\% to 94.0\%) at 27-31 weeks' gestation, and 98.6\% (97.8\% to 99.2\%) at 32-34 weeks' gestation. Only one infant born at 22-23 weeks survived. Data on cerebral palsy were available for 3599 infants (81.0\% of the eligible population). The overall rate of cerebral palsy at 24-26, 27-31, and 32-34 weeks' gestation was 6.9\% (4.7\% to 9.6\%), 4.3\% (3.5\% to 5.2\%), and 1.0\% (0.5\% to 1.9\%), respectively. Responses to the ASQ were analysed for 2506 children (56.4\% of the eligible population). The proportion of children with an ASQ result below threshold at 24-26, 27-31, and 32-34 weeks' gestation were 50.2\% (44.5\% to 55.8\%), 40.7\% (38.3\% to 43.2\%), and 36.2\% (32.4\% to 40.1\%), respectively. Survival without severe or moderate neuromotor or sensory disabilities among live births increased between 1997 and 2011, from 45.5\% (39.2\% to 51.8\%) to 62.3\% (57.1\% to 67.5\%) at 25-26 weeks' gestation, but no change was observed at 22-24 weeks' gestation. At 32-34 weeks' gestation, there was a non-statistically significant increase in survival without severe or moderate neuromotor or sensory disabilities (P=0.61), but the proportion of survivors with cerebral palsy declined (P=0.01). Conclusions In this large cohort of preterm infants, rates of survival and survival without severe or moderate neuromotor or sensory disabilities have increased during the past two decades, but these children remain at high risk of developmental delay.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A considerable amount of literature has documented the impact of hearing impairment on spoken language skills in deaf children referred for cochlear implantation. Critical areas of neurocognitive development in the acquisition of visual (manual) language also appear to be impacted, although the evidence is less robust. The present study focused on the development of visual and fine motor skills in a sample of preschool-age children diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss with no known neurologic conditions (n = 36). STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data collected as part of a standardized screening process for cochlear implantation at an academic medical center. METHOD: Children underwent a standardized neuropsychological assessment battery. Children were classified into three groups based on the etiology of their deafness (Connexin = 15, Structural Malformation = 11, and Unknown = 10). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Correlational analyses replicated previous research on the reduction in visual reception and fine motor skills as deaf children age. Children with genetic (Connexin) etiology exhibited a significant reduction in fine motor skills with age, whereas those with an etiology of Structural Abnormality exhibited a significant reduction in visual reception skills with age. Results of planned comparisons conducted as part of a multivariate analysis of variance (Skill x Group) indicated that the Connexin group was significantly better than the Unknown group with regard to fine motor skills. Implications for these findings and future studies are discussed. \textcopyright{} The American Laryngological, Rhinological \& Otological Society, Inc.},

  abstract = {Cochlear implants (CIs) often work very well for many children and adults with profound sensorineural (SNHL) hearing loss. Unfortunately, while many CI patients display substantial benefits in recognizing speech and understanding spoken language following cochlear implantation, a large number of patients achieve poor outcomes. Understanding and explaining the reasons for poor outcomes following implantation is a very challenging research problem that has received little attention despite the pressing clinical significance. In this paper, we discuss three challenges for future research on CIs. First, we consider the issue of individual differences and variability in outcomes following implantation. At the present time, we still do not have a complete and satisfactory account of the causal underlying factors that are responsible for the enormous individual differences and variability in outcomes. Second, we discuss issues related to the lack of preimplant predictors of outcomes. Very little prospective research has been carried out on the development of preimplant predictors that can be used to reliably identify CI candidates who may be at high risk for a poor outcome following implantation. Other than conventional demographics and hearing history, there are no prognostic tools available to predict speech recognition outcomes after implantation. Finally, we discuss the third challenge \textemdash{} what to do with a CI-user who has a poor outcome. We suggest that new research efforts need to be devoted to studying this neglected clinical population in greater depth to find out why they are doing poorly with their CI and what novel interventions and treatments can be developed to improve their speech recognition outcomes. Using these three challenges as objectives for future research on CIs, we suggest that the field needs to adopt a new narrative grounded in theory and methods from Cognitive Hearing Science and information processing theory. Without knowing which specific biological and neurocognitive factors are responsible for individual differences or understanding the underlying sensory and neurocognitive basis for variability in performance, it is impossible to select a specific approach to habilitation after a deaf adult or child receives a CI. Deaf adults and children who are performing poorly with their CIs are not a homogeneous group and may differ in many different ways from each other, reflecting the dysfunction of multiple brain systems associated with both congenital and acquired deafness. Hearing loss is not only an ear issue, it is also a brain issue too reflecting close links between perception and action and brain, body and world working together as a functionally integrated information processing system to support robust speech recognition and spoken language processing after implantation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bilateral BAHAs in adults with bilateral hearing loss (BHL) have proven to be superior to unilateral fitting, in both audiologically measurements and in overall patient satisfaction. There have been no similar studies in children. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) has shown numerous negative consequences. The objectives of the study were to investigate whether fitting of bilateral BAHAs in children with conductive BHL give additional hearing benefits, to investigate the effects of unilateral hearing aids in children with conductive UHL, and to identify different aspects of auditory problems in children with conductive UHL or BHL. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study involving 22 children with either conductive UHL (unaided or with unilateral hearing aid) or conductive BHL (with unilateral or bilateral BAHAs) and 15 controls. METHODS: Baseline audiometry, tone thresholds in a sound field, speech recognition in noise and sound localization were tested without, and with unilateral and bilateral hearing aids. Two questionnaires, MAIS \& MUSS and IOI-HA, were completed. RESULTS: Two problem areas were identified in the children with hearing impairment: in reactions to sounds and in intelligibility of speech. An additional BAHA in the children with BHL resulted in a tendency to have improved hearing in terms of better sound localization and speech recognition in noise. Fitting of unilateral hearing aids in the children with UHL gave some supplementary benefit in terms of better speech recognition in noise but no positive effect on ability to localize sound could be detected. Even so, all children fitted with hearing aids - either unilaterally or bilaterally - reported a positive outcome with their devices in the self-assessment questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Children with either UHL or BHL displayed several problems within the hearing domain. Fitting of bilateral BAHAs in children with BHL and of a single-sided hearing aid in children with UHL appears to have some supplementary audiological benefits and also renders high patient satisfaction. In order to investigate the possible supplementary effects of hearing aids, a 3-month trial of BAHA on Softband, either unilaterally or bilaterally, may be of value in children with conductive UHL or BHL, respectively.},

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the yearly improvements in speech and language scores after cochlear implantation in children, with the aetiology of the hearing loss and other related factors. Methods: We reviewed the case notes of children with early onset (0-2 years) of hearing loss, who were implanted in their first decade of life between 1992 and 2000 in Great Ormond Street Children Hospital. We assessed the relationship between the improvement of the receptive language and speech scores, on each year after implantation, with the aetiology of hearing loss and with the presence of additional medical problems. Results: Children with a syndromic diagnosis had lower speech and language improvement scores at years 4 and 5 after implantation than children with a hereditary-non syndromic or unknown diagnosis. Vision and vestibular problems were significant negative predictors for speech and language improvement scores. The disability score, i.e. an overall index of additional to the hearing loss problems, had a negative correlation with the speech and language improvement scores. Conclusions: The presence of a syndromic diagnosis, vision or vestibular problems, and the overall level of additional to the hearing loss problems, may be negative prognostic indicators for speech and language improvement after implantation. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Research strategies: We used the decriptors language/linguagem, hearing/audi\c{c}\~ao, prematurity/prematuridade in databases LILACS, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Scielo. Selection criteria: randomized controlled trials, non-randomized intervention studies and descriptive studies (cross-sectional, cohort, case-control projects). Data analysis: The articles were assessed independently by two authors according to the selection criteria. Twenty-six studies were selected, of which seven were published in Brazil and 19 in international literature. Results: Nineteen studies comparing full-term and preterm infants. Two of the studies made comparisons between premature infants small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age. In four studies, the sample consisted of children with extreme prematurity, while other studies have been conducted in children with severe and moderate prematurity. To assess hearing, these studies used otoacoustic emissions, brainstem evoked potentials, tympanometry, auditory steady-state response and visual reinforcement audiometry. For language assessment, most of the articles used the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development. Most studies reviewed observed that prematurity is directly or indirectly related to the acquisition of auditory and language abilities early in life. Conclusion: Thus, it could be seen that prematurity, as well as aspects related to it (gestational age, low weight at birth and complications at birth), affect maturation of the central auditory pathway and may cause negative effects on language acquisition.},

Language and attention problems are among these deficits, although the nature of the relation between attention and language in early development is not well known. This study represents a preliminary attempt to shed light on the relations between attention problems and language development in preterm low-birth-weight children. Methods The aim of this study was to analyse reciprocal influences between language and attention problems from 18 to 36 months. We used maternal reports on attention problems and language ability referring to a sample of 1288 premature low-birth-weight infants, collected as part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). A sample of children born full-term was used as the control group (N = 37010). Cross-lagged panel analyses were carried out to study reciprocal influences between attention problems and language. Results Language ability at 18 months did not significantly predict attention problems at 36 months, adjusting for attention problems at 18 months. Attention problems at 18 months significantly predicted changes in language ability from 18 to 36 months, pointing to a precursor role of attention in relation to language in children born preterm. Gender, age corrected for prematurity, and mother's education emerged as important covariates. Conclusions Preliminary evidence was found for a precursor role of early attention problems in relation to language in prematurity. This finding can contribute to a better understanding of the developmental pathways of attention and language and lead to better management of unfavourable outcomes associated with co-morbid attention and language difficulties.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We present population-based, childhood prevalence rates of and neonatal risk factors for permanent hearing loss among extremely premature infants. METHODS. By using an inception-cohort, longitudinal study design for 1974-2003, we studied permanent hearing loss among 1279 survivors with gestational age of {$\leq$}28 weeks and birth weight of \textbackslash textless1250 g (mortality rate: 42.7\%; lost to follow-up monitoring: 4.7\%) Newborn hearing screening, performed by experienced pediatric audiologists, used click-evoked auditory brainstem response testing after 1975. Survivors underwent repeated behavioral audiologic testing and multidisciplinary follow-up monitoring. Permanent hearing loss was defined as mild/moderate (26-70 dB hearing level), severe/profound (71 to \textbackslash textgreater90 dB hearing level), delayed-onset (diagnosed after previously normal hearing), or progressive (increase in loss of {$\geq$}15 dB hearing level). Permanent hearing loss rates were established at 3 years of age, with newborn, infant, and \textbackslash textgreater5-year final hearing outcomes being recorded. Risk factors were compared for children with and without hearing loss, odds ratios were calculated, and prediction performance was determined through area under the curve analysis. RESULTS. Forty (3.1\%) of 1279 survivors 3 years of age had permanent hearing loss and 24 (1.9\%) had severe/profound loss, with no changes over time. Bilateral delayedonset loss occurred for 4 children (10\%) and progressive loss for 11 children (28\%). One child had auditory neuropathy, and 29 (73\%) had multiple disabilities. Prolonged oxygen use, gastrointestinal surgery, patent ductus arteriosus ligation, and low socioeconomic index yielded good prediction of permanent hearing loss; oxygen use was the most significant predictor of severe/profound loss. CONCLUSIONS. Permanent hearing loss remains an adverse outcome of extreme prematurity, complicated by significant delayed-onset and progressive loss. Prolonged supplemental oxygen use is a marker for predicting permanent hearing loss; this requires detailed analysis of the pathophysiologic features, to reduce the prevalence of permanent hearing loss.

  abstract = {Objectives: This study shows how population-based estimates of the prevalence of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in children aged 6 to 19 yrs can differ considerably with various applications of commonly accepted case definitions. It also examines demographic variables and risk factors related to UHL. Design: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 1988 to 1994, is a national population-based, cross-sectional survey. This study examined Results of audiometric testing at 0.5 to 8 kHz and demographic data from in-person examination interviews. Three definitions of UHL were used: (1) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz {$\geq$}15 dB pure-tone average (PTA); (2) 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz {$\geq$}15 dB PTA; and (3) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz {$\geq$}20 dB or PTA \textbackslash textgreater25 dB at two or more frequencies above 2 kHz (3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz). Case definitions 2 and 3 are not merely subsets of case definition 1. Some overlap exists between the groups, but each case definition classifies a proportion of children who fall uniquely under that case definition. Inclusion of participants based on tympanometry Results (test of middle ear function) was also examined as were demographic characteristics and risk factors associated with UHL. Results: Overall, the weighted proportion of children with UHL using case definition 1 was 6.3\% (approximately 3,213,000 children nationally); using case definition 2, it was 5.8\% (approximately 2,958,000 nationally); using case definition 3, it was 3.0\% (approximately 1,530,000 nationally). For all three case definitions, children who failed tympanometry were at higher risk for UHL than children who passed. For case definition 2, children from rural areas were at higher risk for UHL than were children from urban areas. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that different applications of well-accepted case definitions of UHL can influence population-based prevalence estimates, in this study by as much as a factor of 2. These findings highlight the importance of controlling for tympanometry status as a risk factor in such estimates. Which demographic characteristics and risk factors are significantly associated with hearing loss seem to vary depending on the case definition. These findings have implications for the interpretation of prevalence rates and risk factors in the literature on hearing loss in general. Prevalence rate estimates require careful consideration of the case definition of hearing loss, tympanometry status, and demographic characteristics. \textcopyright{} 2010 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Annual Survey Changes in Student and Program Characteristics, 1984-8S and 1994-9S Arthur N. Schildroth and Sue A. Hotto Data presented in the following pages are from the Annual Survey of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children and Youth conducted by the Center for Assessment and Demographic Studies in Gallaudet University's Research Institute. This is the sixth consecutive year in which the Reference Issue of Annals has published summary Annual Survey data. Previous survey reports in the Reference Issue focused on ethnic background , children under age 6, the full inclusion movement, school leavers, and Annual Survey data in relation to reading test scores of deaf children. Table 1 shows changes in Annual Survey data over a 10year period, between the 1984-85 and 1994-95 school years. At least two significant changes have occurred during this decade. The first relates to the educational placement of children with hearing impairments; the second involves the racial/ethnic background of the children reported to the Annual Survey. The importance of these two variables takes on added significance in light of recent changes proposed for special education in certain parts of the U.S. (e.g., funding reductions and manner of funding for center programs in the Northeast Region, center school closings in the South). The educational placement and racial/ethnic background changes presented here will also interact with the "full inclusion" movement (i.e., the trend to place all disabled children in regular education programs). Several qualifications should be kept in mind in reviewing Annual Survey data. 1. Since the survey is voluntary, it does not include all deaf and hard-of-hearing children receiving special educational services in the U.S. If the number of these children reported by the states to the federal government is accurate, then the Annual Survey includes between 60\% and 70\% of all deaf and hard-of-hearing children receiving special education in this country. 2. The 1984-85 survey included 3,405 children who were not receiving special educational services; in 1994-95 the number of these children had dropped to 2,784. 3. Missing data \^A\textemdash{} that is, questions left unanswered by the school or marked "data not available" \^A\textemdash{} have been excluded from the percentage calculations in Table 1. This point is especially important for any variable with a large amount of missing data (e.g., the "cause of hearing loss" variable). 4. Hispanics may be of any race. 5. Degree of hearing loss was calculated on the basis of an unaided better-ear average \^A\textemdash{} that is, by averaging the pure-tone thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz in the better ear \^A\textemdash{} or, if that information was unavailable, by accepting an estimate by the school of the student's unaided hearing loss. (The distributions of hearing loss resulting from these two methods have been found to be very similar in the Annual Survey database.) 6. In regard to "additional disabilities," schools were asked to report only those additional conditions that were "educationally significant," that is, those that had a substantial effect on the student's learning or required some significant modification of the learning environment.

Objective: To determine the individual and combined prognostic effects of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), ultrasonographic signs of brain injury, and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) on 18-month outcomes of ELBW infants. Design: Inception cohort assembled for the Trial of Indomethacin Prophylaxis in Pre-terms (TIPP). Setting and Participants: A total of 910 infants with birth weights of 500 to 999 g who were admitted to 1 of 32 neonatal intensive care units in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong between 1996 and 1998 and who survived to a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Combined end point of death or survival to 18 months with 1 or more of cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, severe hearing loss, and bilateral blindness. Results: Each of the neonatal morbidities was similarly and independently correlated. with a poor 18-month outcome. Odds ratios were 2.4 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3.2) for BPD, 3.7 (95\% CI, 2.6-5.3) for brain injury, and 3.1 (95\% CI, 1.9-5.0) for severe ROP. In children who were free of BPD, brain injury, and severe ROP the rate of poor long-term outcomes was 18\% (95\% CI, 14\%-22\%). Corresponding rates with any 1, any 2, and all 3 neonatal morbidities were 42\% (95\% CI, 37\%-47\%), 62\% (95\% CI, 53\%-70\%), and 88\% (64\%-99\%), respectively. Conclusion: In ELBW infants who survive to a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks, a simple count of 3 common neonatal morbidities strongly predicts the risk of later death or neurosensory impairment.},

However, despite decades of research and use of these systems in the classroom, there is little evidence supporting their educational effectiveness. In this paper, the authors argue against the use of signing systems as instructional tools. This argument is based upon research demonstrating that (1) signing systems are less comprehensible to learners who rely upon signs rather than speech, (2) signing systems are used inconsistently by teachers, and (3) signing systems often unintentionally exhibit features of natural signed grammar, leading to input that does not accurately convey spoken languages, which is the original intention of these systems. Instead, the authors advocate for a return to the use of natural signed languages in classrooms educating deaf children, with creative uses of interpretation to provide those students who may prefer or benefit from spoken English with its presence in the classroom. In addition, we note ways in which future research may explore how natural sign languages and deaf adults may benefit the educational experiences of deaf children.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of selected predictive factors, primarily age at fitting of amplification and degree of hearing loss, on auditory-based outcomes in young children with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Design: Forty-four infants and toddlers, first identified with mild to profound bilateral hearing loss, who were being fitted with amplification were enrolled in the study and followed longitudinally. Subjects were otherwise typically developing with no evidence of cognitive, motor, or visual impairment. A variety of subject factors were measured or documented and used as predictor variables, including age at fitting of amplification, degree of hearing loss in the better hearing ear, cochlear implant status, intensity of oral education, parent-child interaction, and the number of languages spoken in the home. These factors were used in a linear multiple regression analysis to assess their contribution to auditory-based communication outcomes. Five outcome measures, evaluated at regular intervals in children starting at age 3, included measures of speech perception (Pediatric Speech Intelligibility and Online Imitative Test of Speech Pattern Contrast Perception), speech production (Arizona-3), and spoken language (Reynell Expressive and Receptive Language). Results: The age at fitting of amplification ranged from 1 to 72 mo, and the degree of hearing loss ranged from mild to profound. Age at fitting of amplification showed the largest influence and was a significant factor in all outcome models. The degree of hearing loss was an important factor in the modeling of speech production and spoken language outcomes. Cochlear implant use was the other factor that contributed significantly to speech perception, speech production, and language outcomes. Other factors contributed sparsely to the models. Conclusions: Prospective longitudinal studies of children are important to establish relationships between subject factors and outcomes. This study clearly demonstrated the importance of early amplification on communication outcomes. This demonstration required a participant pool that included children who have been fit at very early ages and who represent all degrees of hearing loss. Limitations of longitudinal studies include selection biases. Families who enroll tend to have high levels of education and rate highly on cooperation and compliance measures. Although valuable information can be extracted from prospective studies, not all factors can be evaluated because of enrollment constraints.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The cost of bilateral cochlear implantation (BCI) is usually not reimbursed by insurance companies because of a lack of well-designed studies reporting the benefits of a second cochlear implant. OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of simultaneous BCI compared with unilateral cochlear implantation (UCI) in adults with postlingual deafness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter randomized clinical trial was performed. The study took place in 5 Dutch tertiary referral centers: the University Medical Centers of Utrecht, Maastricht, Groningen, Leiden, and Nijmegen. Forty patients eligible for cochlear implantation met the study criteria and were included from January 12, 2010, through November 2, 2012. The main inclusion criteria were postlingual onset of hearing loss, age of 18 to 70 years, duration of hearing loss of less than 20 years, and a marginal hearing aid benefit. Two participants withdrew from the study before implantation. Nineteen participants were randomized to undergo UCI and 19 to undergo BCI. INTERVENTIONS: The BCI group received 2 cochlear implants during 1 surgery. The UCI group received 1 cochlear implant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Utrecht Sentence Test with Adaptive Randomized Roving levels (speech in noise, both presented from straight ahead). Secondary outcomes were consonant-vowel-consonant words in silence, speech-intelligibility test with spatially separated sources (speech in noise from different directions), sound localization, and quality of hearing questionnaires. Before any data were collected, the hypothesis was that the BCI group would perform better on the objective and subjective tests that concerned speech intelligibility in noise and spatial hearing. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included in the study. Fifteen patients in the BCI group used hearing aids before implantation compared with 19 in the UCI group. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the groups' baseline characteristics. At 1-year follow-up, there were no significant differences between groups on the Utrecht Sentence Test with Adaptive Randomized Roving levels (9.1 dB, UCI group; 8.2 dB, BCI group; P\,= .39) or the consonant-vowel-consonant test (median percentage correct score 85.0\% in the UCI group and 86.8\% in the BCI group; P = .21). The BCI group performed significantly better than the UCI group when noise came from different directions (median speech reception threshold in noise, 14.4 dB, BCI group; 5.6 dB, BCI group; P {$<$}.001). The BCI group was better able to localize sounds (median correct score of 50.0\% at 60\textdegree, UCI group; 96.7\%, BCI group; P {$<$}.001). These results were consistent with the patients' self-reported hearing capabilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates a significant benefit of simultaneous BCI above UCI in daily listening situations for adults with postlingual deafness.

The frequency of the mothers' signing at 12 and 18 months was significantly correlated: mothers' patterns of frequent or infrequent signing were evident within several months of their infants' entry into programming. Mothers who signed most frequently reported that other adults (father and other relatives, friends) were also learning and using signs. Frequency of sign production by the infants at 18 months correlated significantly with frequency of sign production by the mothers when the infants were 12 and 18 months. The mothers' reports of their typical frequency of signing and of the sign lexicon size of their infants failed to correlate significantly with observed performance.},

Learners' receptive vocabulary size was found to be strongly associated with their reading and writing abilities and moderately associated with their listening ability. However, vocabulary size could still explain a significant and substantial portion of the variance in the listening scores. These results thus emphasise the importance of vocabulary size for language proficiency. Furthermore, it was found that the majority of the learners did not know the most frequent 2000 words in English, but if they did, they would also perform adequately in the listening, reading and writing tests. These findings therefore suggest that the 2000 vocabulary level is a crucial learning goal for low-level EFL learners.},

Most parents expressed positive or neutral feelings about deafness. Concepts of causation varied, with some parents attributing deafness to divine will, others to heredity or physical insult. Many parents reported that their extended families and communities stigmatized the deaf child. Most families were satisfied with the services available. Parents' appraisals of the children's receptive and expressive abilities for oral language were profoundly contradictory.

The results indicate that the deliberations of Hispanic parents are often complicated by language and cultural barriers and by limited access to information, resources, and a full range of options. The communication method chosen tended to be the one recommended by professionals, usually a combination of spoken English and sign language. Parents frequently expressed the hope that their child would learn Spanish as well.

METHOD: School-age CHA and age-matched children with normal hearing (CNH) repeated words and nonwords, learned novel words, and completed a standardized receptive vocabulary test. Analyses of covariance allowed comparison of the 2 groups. For CHA, regression analyses determined whether SII held predictive value over and beyond PTA. RESULTS: CHA demonstrated poorer performance than CNH on tests of word and nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary. Groups did not differ on word learning. Aided SII was a stronger predictor of word and nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary than PTA. After accounting for PTA, aided SII remained a significant predictor of nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wearing hearing aids, CHA performed more poorly on 3 of 4 lexical measures. Individual differences among CHA were predicted by aided SII. Unlike PTA, aided SII incorporates hearing aid amplification characteristics and speech-frequency weightings and may provide a more valid estimate of the child's access to and ability to learn from auditory input in real-world environments.},

This study introduces a new method to assess the effect of age at implantation on cochlear implant outcomes: developmental trajectory analysis (DTA). DTA compares curves representing change in an outcome measure over time (i.e. developmental trajectories) for two groups of children that differ along a potentially important independent variable (e.g. age at intervention). This method was used to compare language development and speech perception outcomes in children who received cochlear implants in the second, third or fourth year of life. Within this range of age at implantation, it was found that implantation before the age of 2 resulted in speech perception and language advantages that were significant both from a statistical and a practical point of view. Additionally, the present results are consistent with the existence of a 'sensitive period' for language development, a gradual decline in language acquisition skills as a function of age.

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to analyze the relative influence of age at implantation, parental expansions, and child language internal factors on grammatical progress in children with cochlear implants (CI). Data analyses used two longitudinal corpora of spontaneous speech samples, one with twenty-two and one with twenty-six children, implanted between 0;6 and 3;10. Analyses were performed on the combined and separate samples. Regression analyses indicate that early child MLU is the strongest predictor of child MLU two and two-and-a-half years later, followed by parental expansions and age at implantation. Associations between earliest MLU gains and MLU two years later point to stability of individual differences. Early type and token frequencies of determiners predict MLU two years later more strongly than early frequency of lexical words. We conclude that features of CI children's very early language have considerable predictive value for later language outcomes.},

Results indicate that during the 2009\textendash 2010 school year 1 in 59 children (specifically 8-year olds) with hearing loss were also receiving services for autism; considerably higher, than reported national estimates of 1 in 91 (Kogan et al. in Pediatrics 124(4):1\textendash 8, 2009) and 1 in 110 (CDC 2007) for hearing children. Significantly more children with profound hearing loss had a comorbid diagnosis of autism than those with milder forms of hearing loss. These results are discussed, while highlighting the need for increased awareness and research in a population that has thus far received little services or attention.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine the validity of the MacArthur\textendash Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) for measuring language abilities in children with profound hearing loss who are using cochlear implants. Method: Twenty-four children with cochlear implants and their mothers participated in this study. Children ranged in age from 32 months to 86 months (the majority were 32 to 66 months old). The number of months postimplantation ranged from 3 to 60 (the majority were around 24 months). Mothers completed the CDI before behavioral testing. Behavioral measures included the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and measures of vocabulary and grammar from a spontaneous language sample. Results: Both the Words and Gestures and the Words and Sentences forms of the CDI were shown to have excellent validity for this sample of children, if they had language that was in the range measured by the instrument. Correlations with behavioral measures ranged from .41 to .93 and were comparable to those reported for children with typical development. Conclusions: The CDI forms are valid tools to use with children who are using cochlear implants and who are in the early stages of language development, even if they are older than the norming sample. Age-equivalence may be obtained if children score below the median for the oldest age norms. They may also be used to describe the language of children who are not at ceiling. Specific recommendations for interventionists are provided. Key Words: cochlear implants, validity of parent report, language development},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study examined the language outcomes of children with mild to severe hearing loss during the preschool years. The longitudinal design was leveraged to test whether language growth trajectories were associated with degree of hearing loss and whether aided hearing influenced language growth in a systematic manner. The study also explored the influence of the timing of hearing aid fitting and extent of use on children's language growth. Finally, the study tested the hypothesis that morphosyntax may be at particular risk due to the demands it places on the processing of fine details in the linguistic input. Design: The full cohort of children in this study comprised 290 children who were hard of hearing (CHH) and 112 children with normal hearing who participated in the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss (OCHL) study between the ages of 2 and 6 years. CHH had a mean better-ear pure-tone average of 47.66 dB HL (SD = 13.35). All children received a comprehensive battery of language measures at annual intervals, including standardized tests, parent-report measures, and spontaneous and elicited language samples. Principal components analysis supported the use of a single composite language score for each of the age levels (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years). Measures of unaided (better-ear pure-tone average, speech intelligibility index) and aided (residualized speech intelligibility index) hearing were collected, along with parent-report measures of daily hearing aid use time. Mixed modeling procedures were applied to examine the rate of change (227 CHH; 94 children with normal hearing) in language ability over time in relation to (1) degree of hearing loss, (2) aided hearing, (3) age of hearing aid fit and duration of use, and (4) daily hearing aid use. Principal components analysis was also employed to examine factor loadings from spontaneous language samples and to test their correspondence with standardized measures. Multiple regression analysis was used to test for differential effects of hearing loss on morphosyntax and lexical development. Results: Children with mild to severe hearing loss, on average, showed depressed language levels compared with peers with normal hearing who were matched on age and socioeconomic status. The degree to which CHH fell behind increased with greater severity of hearing loss. The amount of improved audibility with hearing aids was associated with differential rates of language growth; better audibility was associated with faster rates of language growth in the preschool years. Children fit early with hearing aids had better early language achievement than children fit later. However, children who were fit after 18 months of age improved in their language abilities as a function of the duration of hearing aid use. These results suggest that the language learning system remains open to experience provided by improved access to linguistic input. Performance in the domain of morphosyntax was found to be more delayed in CHH than their semantic abilities. Conclusion: The data obtained in this study largely support the predictions, suggesting that mild to severe hearing loss places children at risk for delays in language development. Risks are moderated by the provision of early and consistent access to well-fit hearing aids that provide optimized audibility.},

Method: A retrospective study was conducted on children with WS who underwent cochlear implantation at the age of 2 years or younger. The post-operative results for speech perception (phonetically balanced standard Dutch consonant-vocal-consonant word lists) and language comprehension (the Reynell Developmental Language Scales, RDLS), expressed as a language quotient (LQ), were compared between the WS group and the reference group by using multiple linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 14 children were diagnosed with WS, and 6 of them had additional disabilities. The WS children were implanted at a mean age of 1.6 years and the 48 children of the reference group at a mean age of 1.3 years. The WS children had a mean phoneme score of 80\% and a mean LQ of 0.74 at 3 years post-implantation, and these results were comparable to those of the reference group. Only the factor additional disabilities had a significant negative influence on auditory perception and language comprehension. Conclusions: Children with WS performed similarly to the reference group in the present study, and these outcomes are in line with the previous literature. Although good counselling about additional disabilities concomitant to the syndrome is relevant, cochlear implantation is a good rehabilitation method for children with WS.},

It is unknown whether these problems decrease, deteriorate, or remain stable over time. The goal of this research was to determine the developmental course of language functions in preterm-born children from 3 to 12 years of age. METHODS: Computerized databases Embase, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and PsycInfo were searched for studies published between January 1995 and March 2011 reporting language functions in pretermborn children. Outcome measures were simple language function assessed by using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and complex language function assessed by using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Pooled effect sizes (in terms of Cohen's d) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for simple and complex language functions were calculated by using random-effects models. Meta-regression was conducted with mean difference of effect size as the outcome variable and assessment age as the explanatory variable. RESULTS: Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple (d = -0.45 [95\% CI: -0.59 to -0.30]; P \textbackslash textless .001) and on complex (d = -0.62 [95\% CI: -0.82 to -0.43]; P \textbackslash textless .001) language function tests, even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status. For complex language function (but not for simple language function), group differences between preterm- and term-born children increased significantly from 3 to 12 years of age (slope = -0.05; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: While growing up, preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

The objective of this study was to retrospectively analyze over 6 years the educational outcome and language development of a first cohort of children, detected by the Flemish universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) program based on automated auditory brainstem response (AABR), with the oldest children being in primary school. Methods: We studied 229 hearing-impaired children from 1998 till 2003. The following variables were considered: the age during the school year 2005-2006, the degree of hearing loss, additional impairments including presence of intellectual disability, school placement and early intervention. Results: Analysis showed that 85.4\% of the children with moderate, severe or profound hearing loss and no additional disability, older than 5.5 years, reach mainstream education. Further detailed description was provided for the outcomes of children with uni- and bilateral cochlear implants. Overall results stress that 46\% of all children with a cochlear implant obtain mainstream education. Of all cochlear implant (CI) children above 5.5 years, without additional handicaps, 78.9\% of children attend primary mainstream school. Data on language development show that up to 45\% of the children with unilateral cochlear implant and no additional disabilities had normal to slight delay on language development. These data are fulfilling the goals stated by the JCIH and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2000. The role and impact of additional handicaps is discussed. The importance of early hearing loss identification and hearing therapy for appropriate language development is highlighted. Finally our preliminary results on children with bilateral cochlear implants without additional handicaps present an improved language development in comparison to unilateral CI-children. Conclusion: A vast majority of the children detected by the UNHS program, with moderate, severe or profound hearing loss and no additional disability, older than 5.5 years, reach mainstream education. Additional disabilities have a major influence. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, not much is known about language development in patients with CHARGE syndrome. In this retrospective study, hearing loss, cognitive abilities, and language development are described in 50 patients with CHARGE syndrome. After informed consent was given, data were collected from local medical files. Most patients (38.3\%; 18/47 patients) had moderate hearing loss (41\textendash 70 dB) and 58.5\% (24/41 patients) had an IQ below 70. The mean language quotients of the receptive and expressive language were more than one standard deviation below the norm. Both hearing loss and cognitive delay had an influence on language development. Language and cognitive data were not available for all patients, which may have resulted in a pre-selection of patients with a delay. In conclusion, while hearing thresholds, cognitive abilities and language development vary widely in CHARGE syndrome, they are mostly below average. Hearing loss and cognitive delay have a significant influence on language development in children with CHARGE syndrome. To improve our knowledge about and the quality of care we can provide to CHARGE patients, hearing and developmental tests should be performed regularly in order to differentiate between the contributions of hearing loss and cognitive delay to delays in language development, and to provide adequate hearing amplification in the case of hearing loss. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The objectives of this study were to determine the early language outcomes of children with mild to profound hearing loss, compared with hearing control children, at 12 to 16 months of age and to examine the effects of "very early" enrollment (\textbackslash textless3 months) in early intervention. METHODS. This was a prospective longitudinal study of the outcomes of a cohort of 30 infants identified in the Rhode Island universal newborn hearing screening program and 96 hearing control subjects. Eligible families with children with all degrees of congenital hearing loss were invited to enroll. Child language skills were assessed by using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory, Words and Gestures, at 12 to 16 months. RESULTS. Children with moderate/profound hearing loss had significantly lower numbers of phrases understood, words understood, and early, later, and total gestures, compared with children with mild/minimal hearing loss and hearing control subjects. Furthermore, children with hearing loss who were enrolled in early intervention at \textbackslash textless3 months had significantly higher percentile scores for number of words understood, words produced, and early, later, and total gestures, compared with those enrolled at \textbackslash textgreater3 months. Regression analyses to test the independent effects on language skills of children with hearing loss identified enrollment in early intervention at \textbackslash textless3 months as an independent predictor of percentile scores for word and early gesture production. CONCLUSIONS. Very early enrollment (\textbackslash textless3 months) in early intervention has beneficial effects on early language for children with hearing loss. Nevertheless, 12-to 16-month-old children with moderate/profound hearing loss exhibit delayed receptive and expressive language skills in oral and signed English modes, compared with peers with either mild/minimal hearing loss or typical hearing sensitivity.

  abstract = {Objectives: Improved long-term outcomes of hearing loss at a population level is the underlying reason for interventions such as newborn hearing screening programs. Therefore, high-quality population surveys are needed for older children across the spectrum of hearing losses that might be detected by such programs, against which to assess future secular improvements. Measured outcomes should cover a broad range of parameters, including health-related quality of life. Design: Population-based cohort study (CHIVOS, the Children with Hearing Impairment in Victoria Outcome Study). Setting: State of Victoria, Australia. Participants: Eighty-six 7- to 8-yr-old children born in Victoria, who were (a) fitted with hearing aids for congenital hearing loss by 4.5 yr and (b) had no intellectual or major physical disability. Measures: Standardized measures of language (CELF and PPVT), articulation (Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation), cognition (WISC), reading, adaptive functioning, health-related quality of life, parent developmental concerns, parent- and teacher-reported intelligibility and behavior, and teacher-reported school functioning. Results: Response rate was 67\% (N = 89). Of the 86 able to be included in analyses, 53 were boys; 22\% had mild, 31\% moderate, 17\% severe, and 29\% profound hearing loss; the mean nonverbal IQ was 104.6 (SD 16.7). The sample scored far below (1.3 to 1.7 SDs) the normative populations on the PPVT and on the Receptive, Expressive and Total CELF scores. On average, children's reading age was delayed nearly 10 mo. For every outcome measure except physical health, these children scored significantly worse than the relevant normative population. Language and vocabulary scores worsened with increasing severity of hearing loss, but adaptive functioning, health-related quality of life, academic skills and behavior did not. Conclusions: Comprehensive data such as these highlight the continuing plight experienced by hearing-impaired children, and will help evaluate over time whether outcomes for children with hearing loss are improving at a population level.},

  abstract = {This review brings together evidence from a diverse field of methods for investigating sex differences in language processing. Differences are found in certain language-related deficits, such as stuttering, dyslexia, autism and schizophrenia. Common to these is that language problems may follow from, rather than cause the deficit. Large studies have been conducted on sex differences in verbal abilities within the normal population, and a careful reading of the results suggests that differences in language proficiency do not exist. Early differences in language acquisition show a slight advantage for girls, but this gradually disappears. A difference in language lateralization of brain structure and function in adults has also been suggested, perhaps following size differences in the corpus callosum. Neither of these claims is substantiated by evidence. In addition, overall results from studies on regional grey matter distribution using voxel-based morphometry, indicate no consistent differences between males and females in language-related cortical regions. Language function in Wada tests, aphasia, and in normal ageing also fails to show sex differentiation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Patients and Setting: Congenitally profoundly deaf children were implanted with the Nucleus multichannel cochlear implant at \textbackslash textless5 years of age and followed at NYU Medical Center for a period of 1-5 years. Main Outcome Measures: Open set speech perception was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the following: the Glendonald Auditory Screening Procedure (GASP) word subset, the GASP sentence subtest. Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten monosyllabic word lists. Common Phrases test. Multisyllabic Lexical Neighborhood test, and Lexical Neighborhood test. Results: Correlation coefficients were calculated between scores at each interval and age at implantation; one-way analyses of variance were performed independently. Results showed that all subjects had significant open-set speech recognition at the time of the last postoperative evaluation. Thirty seven of the children use oral language as their sole means of communication.

The goal was to examine the relationships between management after confirmation, family participation, and speech and language outcomes in the same group of children with permanent childhood hearing impairment. METHODS. Speech, oral language, and nonverbal abilities, expressed as z scores and adjusted in a regression model, and Family Participation Rating Scale scores were assessed at a mean age of 7.9 years for 120 children with bilateral permanent childhood hearing impairment from a 1992-1997 United Kingdom birth cohort. Ages at institution of management and hearing aid fitting were obtained retrospectively from case notes. RESULTS. Compared with children managed later (\textbackslash textgreater9 months), those managed early ({$\leq$}9 months) had higher adjusted mean z scores for both receptive and expressive language, relative to nonverbal ability, but not for speech. Compared with children aided later, a smaller group of more-impaired children aided early did not have significantly higher scores for these outcomes. Family Participation Rating Scale scores showed significant positive correlations with language and speech intelligibility scores only for those with confirmation after 9 months and were highest for those with late confirmed, severe/profound, permanent childhood hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS. Early management of permanent childhood hearing impairment results in improved language. Family participation is also an important factor in cases that are confirmed late, especially for children with severe or profound permanent childhood hearing impairment.

The children also received regular home visits from a hearing parent adviser who helped the family promote the child's early listening, English, and literacy skills. The result was a bilingual-bicultural home environment for these children. The children who received deaf mentor services were compared to matched children who did not receive these services but who received parent adviser services. Children receiving this early bilingual-bicultural programming made greater language gains during treatment time, had considerably larger vocabularies, and scored higher on measures of communication, language, and English syntax than the matched children.},

The study group involved 11438 infants born before 33 wga, the control group\textemdash 1487730 infants. Screening was performed by means of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. The risk factors of hearing loss were recorded. Infants who failed the screening test and/or had risk factors were referred for further audiological evaluation. Results Hearing deficit was diagnosed in 11\% of infants 25 wga, 5\% at 26\textendash 27 wga, 3.46\% at 28 wga and 2\textendash 3\% at 29\textendash 32 wga. In the control group the incidence of hearing deficit was 0.2\% (2.87\% with risk factors). The most important risk factors were craniofacial malformations, very low birth weight, low Apgar score and mechanical ventilation. Hearing screening was positive in 22.42\% newborns 28 wga and 10\% at 29\textendash 32 wga and in the control group. Conclusions Hearing impairment is a severe consequence of prematurity. Its prevalence is inversely related to the maturity of the baby. Premature infants have many concomitant risk factors which influence the occurrence of hearing deficit.},

We compared the receptive and expressive language abilities of 72 deaf or hard-of-hearing children whose hearing losses were identified by 6 months of age with 78 children whose hearing losses were identified after the age of 6 months. All of the children received early intervention services within an average of 2 months after identification. The participants' receptive and expressive language abilities were measured using the Minnesota Child Development Inventory. Results. Children whose hearing losses were identified by 6 months of age demonstrated significantly better language scores than children identified after 6 months of age. For children with normal cognitive abilities, this language advantage was found across all test ages, communication modes, degrees of hearing loss, and socioeconomic strata. It also was independent of gender, minority status, and the presence or absence of additional disabilities. Conclusions. Significantly better language development was associated with early identification of hearing loss and early intervention. There was no significant difference between the earlier- and later-identified groups on several variables frequently associated with language ability in deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Thus, the variable on which the two groups differed (age of identification and intervention) must be considered a potential explanation for the language advantage documented in the earlier-identified group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, no studies have examined vocabulary outcomes of children meeting all 3 components of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) guidelines (hearing screening by 1 month, diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 months, and intervention by 6 months of age). The primary purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the current EHDI 1-3-6 policy on vocabulary outcomes across a wide geographic area. A secondary goal was to confirm the impact of other demographic variables previously reported to be related to language outcomes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 448 children with bilateral hearing loss between 8 and 39 months of age (mean = 25.3 months, SD = 7.5 months). The children lived in 12 different states and were participating in the National Early Childhood Assessment Project. RESULTS: The combination of 6 factors in a regression analysis accounted for 41\% of the variance in vocabulary outcomes. Vocabulary quotients were significantly higher for children who met the EHDI guidelines, were younger, had no additional disabilities, had mild to moderate hearing loss, had parents who were deaf or hard of hearing, and had mothers with higher levels of education. CONCLUSIONS: Vocabulary learning may be enhanced with system improvements that increase the number of children meeting the current early identification and intervention guidelines. In addition, intervention efforts need to focus on preventing widening delays with chronological age, assisting mothers with lower levels of education, and incorporating adults who are deaf/hard-of-hearing in the intervention process.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis: Early identification and intervention, earlier cochlear implantation, and mother's level of education will directly and/or indirectly impact the language outcomes of children with cochlear implants (CIs). Background: Identifying factors that contribute to the wide range of language outcomes in children who use CIs will assist healthcare and rehabilitation professionals in optimizing service delivery for this population. Universal newborn hearing screening provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between meeting the early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) 1-3-6 guidelines and child language outcomes. These guidelines recommend screening by 1 month, confirmation of hearing loss by 3 months, and intervention by 6 months of age. Methods: Participants were 125 children with CIs ranging from 13 to 39 months of age. Language ability was measured using the Child Development Inventory and MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. Results: Meeting EHDI 1-3-6, higher levels of maternal education and earlier cochlear implant activation had a direct, positive impact on language outcomes. Meeting the EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines also had an indirect positive effect on language outcomes via increasing the probability that the children's CIs would be activated earlier. Maternal education did not significantly predict age of cochlear implant activation nor whether a child met EHDI 1-3-6. Conclusion: Ensuring families meet the EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines is an early step that can lead to higher language outcomes and also earlier cochlear implantation.},
