This folder contains supplemental materials from Characterizing North Carolina's Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing Infants and Toddlers: Predictors of Vocabulary, Diagnosis, and Intervention.

comorbidity_info.csv (S1): Additional Diagnoses (n = {n_condition(anycomorbid)}): Ns of participants in our sample diagnosed with other conditions. N.B.: Ns do not sum to total because many participants had multiple diagnoses.

audiological_info.csv (S2): Audiological Characteristics of the Sample: First two columns describe laterality and amplification type (cochlear implant (CI), hearing aid (HA), or none). Mean decibels of hearing loss (HL) in better ear, worse ear, and the mean age (in months) of amplification, and cochlear implantation (when applicable) for each laterality and amplification combination.

language_info.csv (S3): Language and Communication Characteristics of the Sample: Ns of participants by language background and communication method.

delay_betas.csv (S4): Unstandardized beta weights (months of vocabulary delay) for the model of vocabulary delay selected by AIC.

diagnosis_betas.csv (S5): Unstandardized beta coefficients (months) for the model of age at diagnosis selected by AIC.

intervention_betas (S6): Unstandardized beta coefficients (months) for the model of age at intervention selected by AIC.

AllTables.pdf (S7): PDF containing all figures and tables with their captions in situ (for reader/reviewer ease).

AllTables.Rmd: Rmd used to create S7
AllTables.log: log file associated with S7
