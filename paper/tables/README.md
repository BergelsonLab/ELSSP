This folder contains tables from Characterizing North Carolina's Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing Infants and Toddlers: Predictors of Vocabulary, Diagnosis, and Intervention.

**Table 2**: For categorical variables, levels are described. Some participants had missing information for some variables, thus totals may not sum to 100. For continuous variables, range, mean, and standard deviation are provided. For CDI, participants were either administered Words and Gestures or Words and Sentences.
