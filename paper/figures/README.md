This folder contains figures from Characterizing North Carolina's Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing Infants and Toddlers: Predictors of Vocabulary, Diagnosis, and Intervention.

**Figure 1**: Results of chi-square tests between variables. X- and y-axes show the variables compared. Color of the square represents significance of the corresponding chi-square test. For tests that survived Bonferroni correction (p<.0007), effect size (Cramer's V) is given. (For the chi-square test, services received per month was binned into 0-2, 3-6, and >7 - services/month to create maximally evenly sized bins.)

**Figure 2**: Lines show the growth curves created from Wordbank 50th percentile data. Left panels show Words & Gestures; right panels show Words & Sentences. Top row is American English data; bottom row is Mexican Spanish data. Dots represent vocabulary scores of individual DHH children in the sample.

**Figure 3**: Age at diagnosis, intervention, amplification, and cochlear implantation across participants. Each dot represents the age that one child received the clinical service; violin width reflects data distribution. Blacks dot and whiskers show means and standard errors. Not all children received amplification (hearing aids) or implantation (cochlear implants).

**Figure 4**: Estimated vocabulary delay for children who meet 1-3-6 guidelines for diagnosis/intervention (top) and children who do not (bottom). Each dot represents one child in the sample; violin width reflect data distribution. Blacks dot and whiskers show means and standard error.

**Figure 5**: Unstandardized coefficients (measured in months) with confidence intervals for the models selected by AIC for: (A) vocabulary delay, (B) age at diagnosis, (C) age at intervention.
