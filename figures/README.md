This folder contains figures. The functions for these figures lives in BergelsonLab/ELSSP. The code lives in "Difference from CDI Norms.ipynb".

There are several types of plots currently in this folder (3/16/2020). WG/WS refers to which version of the CDI is displayed: Words and Gestures or Words and Sentences.
(WG/WS)_trajectories.pdf - compares ELSSP CDI scores to normative CDI data curves.
Plots for specific variables (e.g., gender) are housed in subfolders for that varaible. Currently: gender, amplification, communication, laterality, dev_delay, prematurity, meets136, and etiology. Each subfolder contains 6 plots:
(WG/WS)_(variable)_deficit.pdf - rain plot for score deficit based on given variable (ex: male vs. female)
(WG/WS)_(variable)_delay.pdf - rain plot for delay in months based on given variable (ex: male vs. female)
(WG/WS)_(variable)_trajectories.pdf - shows trajectories based on a given variable (ex: male vs. female) compared to normative curves
(WG/WS)_(variable)_trajectories.pdf - shows longitudinal trajectories based on a given variable (ex: male vs. female) compared to normative curves

Issues: 
Code mislabels deficit plots as "delay" and vice versa
EC needs to generate plots for a few more variables
